              </li>
              <li>

          <p class="formalpara">
				Once the preconditions and requirements have been met, you are ready to install the Mobicents binary distribution.

          <div class="procedure">
            <a id="procedure-Downloading_and_Verifying_the_Mobicents_Distribution"></a>
            <ol class="1">
              <li>
                <p>
					First, Download the latest version of the Mobicents binary distribution. The latest version can be found by going to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mobicents/">Mobicents project page on SourceForge.net</a>, clicking on <span class="emphasis"><em>Download Mobicents</em></span>, and then looking for <span class="emphasis"><em>Mobicents Server</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Latest Version</em></span>.
				</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
					Then verify the integrity of the zip file. Along with the zip file there is a sha1 file<sup>[<a id="id269943" href="#ftn.id269943">1</a>]</sup> which contains a checksum that can be used to verify the integrity of the zip file, and can alert you if the file has been changed since it was uploaded, or if it was corrupted upon download.
				</p>
                <p>
					On a Linux system you can use the <code class="command">sha1sum</code> command to verify the integrity of the binary distribution zip file.
				</p>
                <p>
					On a Windows system you will need to download a sha1sum-generating program such as the <code class="command">sha1sum.exe</code> program. This will generate a checksum that you can compare with the sum in the sha1 file.
				</p>
                <p>
					Note that if the two checksums are not identical, it means that the downloaded zip file was corrupted upon download, or has been changed since it was last uploaded to the server.
				</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
					Finally, install the Mobicents Converged Application Server. Unzip the Mobicents binary distribution zip file to the location where you want it, thus completing the install.

			Besides simply installing the latest binary Mobicents release, you can also build the Mobicents Converged Application Server from source. There are several reasons for building Mobicents from source, including getting access to new features such as the latest resource adapters, bundled servers and examples, getting full support for debugging, and accessing extra documentation.
		</p>
          <p>
			Note that building Mobicents from source requires a working installation of JBoss 4.2. This section on building Mobicents from source also includes the steps necessary for installing the JBoss 4.2.2 binary distribution.

                <p>
					You must have sufficient disk space in order to install the Mobicents source as well as the JBoss binary distribution. The Mobicents source, once fetched from the development Subversion repository, will consume about 230 MB of disk space. In addition to this, the JBoss Application Server binary distribution requires approximately 140 MB, meaning that you should probably have <span class="emphasis"><em>at least</em></span> 400 MB of free disk space available. Keep in mind also that disk space requirements may change with subsequent updates to the development repository.

				Once the pre-install requirements have been met, you are ready to start.

            <a id="procedure-Downloading_and_Installing_JBoss"></a>
            <h6>Procedure 1.1. Downloading and Installing JBoss</h6>
            <ol class="1">
              <li>
                <p>
					First, move to the directory that you want to install JBoss into, and download the JBoss 4.2.2 General Availability (<acronym class="acronym">GA</acronym>) binary distribution <sup>[<a id="jboss_sourceforge_link" href="#ftn.jboss_sourceforge_link">2</a>]</sup>:
				</p>
                <pre class="screen">cd &lt;directory_to_install_jboss_into&gt;
wget http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/jboss/jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip
</pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
					Next, assuming you want to install JBoss in the same directory you downloaded the zip file distribution to, unzip it:
				</p>
                <pre class="screen">unzip jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip
</pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
					Finally, we must set the <code class="envar">JBOSS_HOME</code> environment variable. The quick-and-easy way to set it for the current session, but which will not last beyond the next reboot, is to <code class="command">export</code> the variable on the command line, and then to <code class="command">echo</code> the variable to make sure that it contains the right directory. For example:
				</p>
                <pre class="screen">export JBOSS_HOME="${PWD}/jboss-4.2.2.GA"
echo $JBOSS_HOME
/home/my_name/jboss/jboss-4.2.2.GA
</pre>
                <p>
					If the <code class="command">echo</code> command doesn't produce any output, make sure that you are in the directory that you unzipped the JBoss binary distribution zip file to, and that the name of that directory is correct in the <code class="command">export</code> command (i.e., that the file name hasn't changed in some subtle way).
				</p>
                <p>
					Alternatively, you can set the <code class="envar">JBOSS_HOME</code> environment variable permanently in the startup file for your shell. If you are using the Bash shell, this would mean inserting the following line into your <code class="filename">~/.bashrc</code> file (and making sure that the pathname is absolute): 
</p>
                <pre class="screen">export JBOSS_HOME="&lt;unzip_directory&gt;/jboss-4.2.2.GA"
</pre>
                <p>
				</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
			Now that the JBoss Application Server has been successfully installed, we will download the source to the Mobicents Converged Application Server with Subversion, and build it.

              <li>
                <p>
					First, move to the directory that you want to install Mobicents into, create a directory named <code class="filename">mobicents</code> into which you'll install everything, and then use Subversion to get the latest sources:
				</p>
                <pre class="screen">cd &lt;directory_to_install_mobicents_source_into&gt;
mkdir mobicents
svn co http://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/trunk mobicents
</pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
					Once Subversion has finished acquiring the latest revision of the sources, which may take a while, then we will then proceed to build Mobicents:
				</p>
                <pre class="screen">ant -f mobicents/core/build.xml
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 6 seconds

          </div>
          <p>
			TBD: Close with a sentence and direct the reader with a ulink to the Running Mobicents (which was installed from source) chapter. Issues that need to be addressed in this chapter include: installing GWT 1.3, which only comes in source for x86 (not version 1.4) and then building the management console.This chapter will have to be expanded with those instructions.

				EclipSLEE can be installed simply by adding the URL of the Update site. In Eclipse, click on <span><strong class="guimenu">Help</strong></span> → <span><strong class="guimenuitem">Software Updates</strong></span> → <span><strong class="guimenuitem">Find and Install...</strong></span>. The <code class="literal">Install/Update</code> dialog box will pop up.

On the right-hand side, click the <span><strong class="guibutton">New Remote Site...</strong></span> button to be presented with the <code class="literal">New Update Site</code> dialog. For the Name field, enter <strong class="userinput"><code>EclipSLEE</code></strong>, and in the <code class="literal">URL</code> field, enter the URL of the remote site: <strong class="userinput"><code>http://people.redhat.com/vralev/eclipslee/update/</code></strong>.

Eclipse will then prompt you to read and accept the license agreement, and will also ask you whether you want to install all components. After following the instructions of Eclipse's plugin install wizard, the EclipSLEE plugin will be downloaded and installed (usually to the shared Eclipse plugins directory, unless you have directed Eclipse to install to another location). Restarting Eclipse is required in order to initialize the EclipSLEE plugin so that it can be used.
