			<title>Downloading</title>
			<para>When you download the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server binary distribution, you can also choose to verify the integrity of the zip file you download, which is both preferred and safer. If you are setting up Mobicents in a production environment (as opposed to, say, merely playing around with Mobicents' capabilities on your personal machine), we recommend verifying the integrity of the downloaded distribution. The first procedure following shows you how to simply download the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server binary distribution, while the second procedure following details how to download <emphasis>and</emphasis> verify the installation zip file.</para>
			<procedure>
				<title>Downloading Without Verifying</title>
				<step>
					<para>You can download the latest version of the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server from <ulink
							url="http://www.mobicents.org/jainsleedownload.html"/>. The top row of the table hold the latest version. Click the <literal>Download</literal> link on the right to start the download from Sourceforge.net.</para>
				</step>
			</procedure>
			<procedure>
				<title>Downloading and Verifying</title>
				<step>
					<para>The preferred&#8212;and safer&#8212;way to obtain the JAIN SLEE Server binary distribution is to download the binary zip file as well as its corresponding sha1 file, and use the sha1 file to verify the integrity of the zip file. To do this, first go to <ulink
							url="http://www.mobicents.org/jainsleedownload.html"/> and, at the top of the page, click on the <literal>here</literal> in <quote>Browse all files <literal>here</literal>
								</quote> link. The most recent releases are located near the top. Download both the zip file and its attendant sha1 file. For example, if you wanted to download the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server version 1.20 Release Candidate 1, you would download both of the following files:</para>
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>mobicents-all-1.2.0.CR1-jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>mobicents-all-1.2.0.CR1-jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip.sha1.asc</para>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Next, verify the integrity of the zip file with the sha1 file, which contains a checksum which is used to do precisely this, and which can alert you if the file has been changed since it was uploaded, or if it was corrupted upon download.</para>
					<para>On a Linux system you can use the <command>sha1sum</command> command to verify the integrity of the binary distribution zip file.</para>
					<para>On a Windows system you will need to download a sha1sum-generating program such as the <command>sha1sum.exe</command> program. This program will generate a checksum that you can compare with the sum in the sha1 file.</para>
					<para>If the two checksums are identical, then the downloaded binary distribution zip file's integrity is assured, and it is safe to proceed with installation.</para>
					<warning>
						<title>Beware of a Corrupted or Compromised Zip File!</title>
						<para>If the two checksums are <emphasis>not</emphasis> identical, it means that the downloaded zip file was corrupted upon download, or has been changed since it was last uploaded to the server. In this case, you should first re-download the two files (the zip file and the sha1 file) and compare once more. If this second comparison fails, it could indicate a problem with the install file, and you should contact the Mobicents team by email to alert them to the conflict.</para>

			</note>
			<procedure>
				<title>Installing the Mobicents Binary Distribution on Linux</title>
				<step>
					<para>First, move to the directory to which you downloaded the binary distribution zip file. For this example, we'll assume you're currently in your home directory, and that you downloaded the zip file to a subdirectory of it, referred to as <filename>&lt;downloads&gt;</filename>.</para>
					<screen>~]# cd &lt;downloads&gt;</screen>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>In <filename>&lt;downloads&gt;</filename>, create a subdirectory to hold the unzipped Mobicents files. It is good practice to include the version number in this directory name; if you do so, remember to correctly match it with the version of the Mobicents binary distribution you downloaded.</para>
					<screen>&lt;downloads&gt;]$ mkdir &quot;mobicents-&lt;version&gt;&quot;</screen>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Move the downloaded zip file into the directory you just created:</para>
					<screen>&lt;downloads&gt;]$ mv &quot;mobicents-jainslee-server-1.2.0.CR2-jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip&quot; &quot;mobicents-&lt;version&gt;&quot;</screen>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Move into that directory:</para>
					<screen>&lt;downloads&gt;]$ cd &quot;mobicents-&lt;version&gt;&quot;</screen>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Finally, use Java's <command>jar <option>-xvf</option>
							</command> command to extract the contents of the zip file into the current directory, thus completing the install:</para>
					<screen>mobicents-&lt;version&gt;]$ jar -xvf &quot;mobicents-jainslee-server-1.2.0.CR2-jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip&quot;</screen>
					<stepalternatives>
						<step>
							<para>Alternatively, if Linux's <command>unzip</command> utility is present on your system or is installable, you can use it in lieu of Java's <command>jar <option>-xvf</option>
									</command> command:</para>
							<screen>mobicents-&lt;version&gt;]$ unzip &quot;mobicents-jainslee-server-1.2.0.CR2-jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip&quot;</screen>
							<tip>
								<para>You can also use <command>unzip</command>'s <option>-d</option>
									<filename>
								<replaceable>&lt;unzip_to_location&gt;</replaceable>
							</filename> option to extract the zip file's contents to a location other than the current directory.</para>
							</tip>
						</step>
					</stepalternatives>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>To free disk space, you may want to delete the zip file once you've extracted its contents:</para>
					<screen>mobicents-&lt;version&gt;]$ rm &quot;mobicents-jainslee-server-1.2.0.CR2-jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip&quot;</screen>
				</step>
			</procedure>
			<procedure>
				<title>Installing the Mobicents Binary Distribution on Windows</title>
				<step>
					<para>For this example, we'll assume that you downloaded the binary distribution zip file to the <filename>My Downloads</filename> folder. First, using Windows Explorer, create a subfolder in <filename>My Downloads</filename> to extract the zip file's contents into. When you name this folder, it is good practice to include the version number; if you do so, remember to correctly match it with the version of the Mobicents binary distribution you downloaded. In these instructions, we will refer to this folder as <filename>mobicents-&lt;version&gt;</filename>.</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Double-click the downloaded zip file, selecting as the destination folder the one you just created to hold the zip file's contents.</para>
					<stepalternatives>
						<step>
							<para>Alternatively, it is also possible to use Java's <command>jar <option>-xvf</option>
									</command> command to extract the binary distribution files from the zip archive. To use this method instead, first move the downloaded zip file from <filename>My Downloads</filename> to the folder that you just created to hold the Mobicents files.</para>
						</step>
						<step>
							<para>Then, open the Windows Command Prompt and navigate to the folder holding the archive using the <command>cd</command> command:</para>
							<tip
								id="tip-binary-JAIN_SLEE_Server-Opening_the_Command_Prompt_from_Windows_Explorer">
								<title>Opening the Command Prompt from Windows Explorer</title>
								<para>If you are using Windows Vista®, you can open the Command Prompt directly from Explorer. Hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key and right-click on either a folder, the desktop, or inside a folder. This will cause an <guimenuitem>Open Command Window Here</guimenuitem> context menu item to appear, which can be used to open the Command Prompt with the current working directory set to either the folder you opened, or opened it from.</para>
							</tip>
							<screen>C:\Users\Me&gt;cd &quot;My Downloads\mobicents-&lt;version&gt;&quot;</screen>
						</step>
						<step>
							<para>Finally, use the <command>jar <option>-xvf</option>
									</command> command to extract the archive contents into the current folder.</para>
							<screen>C:\Users\Me\My Downloads\mobicents-&lt;version&gt;&gt;jar -xvf &quot;mobicents-jainslee-server-1.2.0.CR2-jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip&quot;</screen>
						</step>
					</stepalternatives>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>At this point, you may want to move the folder holding the Mobicents binary files (in this example, the folder named <filename>mobicents-&lt;version&gt;</filename>) to another location. This step is not strictly necessary, but it is probably a good idea to move the Mobicents folder from <filename>My Downloads</filename> to a user-defined location for storing runnable programs. Any location will suffice, however.</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>You may also want to delete the zip file after extracting its contents in order to free disk space:</para>
					<screen>C:\Users\Me\My Downloads\mobicents-&lt;version&gt;delete &quot;mobicents-jainslee-server-1.2.0.CR2-jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip&quot;</screen>

									<para>On Linux and UNIX-based operating systems, Meld is the Swiss Army knife of version control tools (<acronym>VCSes</acronym>). It can do 2- and 3-way diffs between files, diffs between directory hierarchies, and also serves as a graphical <acronym>VCS</acronym> front-end for the Subversion Version Control System, as well as Git, Darcs, Mercurial, Bazaar(-NG), Monotone, Perforce and CVS, among possible others. Note that you also need the basic Subversion shell client installed before Meld can function with it. Meld is available from <ulink
