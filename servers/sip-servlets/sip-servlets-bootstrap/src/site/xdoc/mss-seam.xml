			<section name="The Seam Telco Framework (STF)">
			<p>On top of <a href="http://www.seamframework.org/">JBoss Seam</a>, Sip Servlets and MSC API (from Mobicents Media Server), we have built another framework that
			allows you to handle SIP and Media events in your Seam components. The STF application are extremely
			lean and simple to code. You could use it for both rapid prototyping or real applications. There are a number of other advantages to using Seam - easier to mix
			Web and SIP and Media components, hot deployment with JBoss Tools, unified component model, transaction management, IoC, AOP and many others.

			There are a number of examples you can see in the documentation. We are also building <a href="mss-ipbx.html">our Mobicents IPBX</a> using STF.

				Mobicents Sip Servlets has been tested heavily with Seam and we have two example application that can help you get started -
