Sip Servlets Conference Demo

* Service Description

	This example is focusing on the interaction with the more advanced features in Mobicents Media Server - endpoint composition and conferencing.
	It is using the {{{http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/}Google's GWT}} Ajax framework with {{{http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-incubator/wiki/ServerPushFAQ}server-push}}
	updates (a.k.a "reverse Ajax" or Comet) to provide desktop-like experience for the user interface.
	The application is demonstrating how Sip Servlets can work seamlessly with any third-party web framework without repackaging or modifying the deployment descriptors.
	All that is needed are a two Java annotations in the code to specify the application name and the servlet name, nothing else.
