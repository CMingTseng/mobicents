 <title>SbbObjectConcurrencyTest</title>
 <description>Tests that the SLEE invokes sbb event handler methods and callbacks serially,
  by blocking inside method invocations and ensuring that no other methods are called on
  the same sbb object during the block.</description>

 <!-- waitPeriodMs specifies the number of milliseconds to block during a method invocation.
  The lower it is set, the less likely the test will detect the failure case.
  The higher it is set, the more likely the SLEE will timeout the pending events.-->
