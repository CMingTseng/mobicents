* How to play with it

	We can distinguish two uses cases here : One where the call is blocked and one where the call is forwarded
	
** Call Blocked

	Start two SIP Phones of your choice such as one of the account name 
	should be forward-receiver on ip address 127.0.0.1 and port 5090
	and the other one should be blocked-sender
   
	The SIP phones don't have to be registered.

	From the blocked-sender phone, make a call to sip:receiver@sip-servlets.com you should receive a Forbidden.

** Call Forwarded
 
	Start two SIP Phones of your choice such as one of the account name 
	should be forward-receiver on ip address 127.0.0.1 and port 5090
	and the other one should be forward-sender
   
	The SIP phones don't have to be registered.

	From the forward-sender phone, make a call to sip:receiver@sip-servlets.com you should have the phone "forward-receiver" ringing.
