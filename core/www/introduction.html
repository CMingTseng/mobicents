		<p>
		Mobicents is the first and only Open Source VoIP Platform <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/MobicentsSLEE10Cert">certified</a>
		for JSLEE 1.0 compliance. Mobicents brings to telecom applications a robust component model and execution environment. It compliments J2EE to enable convergence
		of voice, video and data in next generation intelligent applications.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the scope of telecom Next Generation Intelligent Networks (NGIN), Mobicents fits in as a high-performance core engine for Service Delivery Platforms (SDP) and IP Multimedia SubSystems 
		
		(IMS).
		</p>
		<p>
		Mobicents enables the composition of Service Building Blocks (SBB) such as call control, billing, user provisioning, administration, and presence sensitive features.  
		
		The <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jain/article_slee_principles.html"/>JAIN SLEE</a>
		 specification allows popular protocol stacks such as 
		<a href="https://jain-sip.dev.java.net/">SIP</a>
		to be plugged in as resource adapters. The SLEE service building blocks - SBBs have many similarities to EJBs.  
		
		The extensible standard architecture naturally accomodates integration points with enterprise applications such as Web, CRM or SOA end points.
		</p>
		<p>
		Monitoring and management of Mobicents components comes out of the box via SLEE standard based JMX and SNMP interfaces. This makes Mobicents servers an easy choice for telecom Operations Support Systems (OSS) and Network Management Systems (NMS).
		</p>
		<p>
		Beyond telecommunications, Mobicents is applicable to a wider variety of problems demanding high volume, low latency signaling. Examples include financial trading, online gaming, sensor network integration (RFID) and distributed control.
