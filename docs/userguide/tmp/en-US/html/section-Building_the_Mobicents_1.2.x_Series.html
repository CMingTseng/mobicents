			Besides simply installing the latest binary Mobicents release, you can also build the Mobicents Converged Application Server from source. There are several reasons for building Mobicents from source, including getting access to new features such as the latest resource adapters, bundled servers and examples, getting full support for debugging, and accessing extra documentation.
		</p>
      <p>
			Note that building Mobicents from source requires a working installation of JBoss 4.2. This section on building Mobicents from source also includes the steps necessary for installing the JBoss 4.2.2 binary distribution.

				Both the Mobicents Converged Application Server and the JBoss Application Server are 100% Java. Mobicents will run on the same hardware that the JBoss Application Server runs on.

				You should ensure a few things before downloading and installing the JBoss binary distribution and the Mobicents source:

        <ul>

            <p>
					You must have sufficient disk space in order to install the Mobicents source as well as the JBoss binary distribution. The Mobicents source, once fetched from the development Subversion repository, will consume about 230 MB of disk space. In addition to this, the JBoss Application Server binary distribution requires approximately 140 MB, meaning that you should probably have <span class="emphasis"><em>at least</em></span> 400 MB of free disk space available. Keep in mind also that disk space requirements may change with subsequent updates to the development repository.
				</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
					A working installation of Java 1.5 or higher is required in order to run Mobicents and the JBoss Application Server.

          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
					The Apache Ant build tool. Mobicents includes this in its distribution, but we will need Ant in order to then build the Ant that comes bundled with the distribution.

				Once the pre-install requirements have been met, you are ready to start. We will split the entire procedure, which isn't long but may take a while depending on the speed of your Internet connection, into two parts: in the first we will install JBoss; in the second, we will download and build Mobicents.
			</p>
      <div class="procedure">
        <a id="procedure-Downloading_and_Installing_JBoss"></a>
        <h6>Procedure 2.1. Downloading and Installing JBoss</h6>
        <ol class="1">
          <li>
            <p>
					First, move to the directory that you want to install JBoss into, and download the JBoss 4.2.2 General Availability (<acronym class="acronym">GA</acronym>) binary distribution <sup>[<a id="jboss_sourceforge_link" href="#ftn.jboss_sourceforge_link">3</a>]</sup>:
				</p>
            <pre class="screen">cd &lt;directory_to_install_jboss_into&gt;
wget http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/jboss/jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
					Next, assuming you want to install JBoss in the same directory you downloaded the zip file distribution to, unzip it:
				</p>
            <pre class="screen">unzip jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
					Finally, we must set the <code class="envar">JBOSS_HOME</code> environment variable. The quick-and-easy way to set it for the current session, but which will not last beyond the next reboot, is to <code class="command">export</code> the variable on the command line, and then to <code class="command">echo</code> the variable to make sure that it contains the right directory. For example:
				</p>
            <pre class="screen">export JBOSS_HOME="${PWD}/jboss-4.2.2.GA"
echo $JBOSS_HOME
/home/my_name/jboss/jboss-4.2.2.GA
</pre>
            <p>
					If the <code class="command">echo</code> command doesn't produce any output, make sure that you are in the directory that you unzipped the JBoss binary distribution zip file to, and that the name of that directory is correct in the <code class="command">export</code> command (i.e., that the file name hasn't changed in some subtle way).
				</p>
            <p>
					Alternatively, you can set the <code class="envar">JBOSS_HOME</code> environment variable permanently in the startup file for your shell. If you are using the Bash shell, this would mean inserting the following line into your <code class="filename">~/.bashrc</code> file (and making sure that the pathname is absolute): 
</p>
            <pre class="screen">export JBOSS_HOME="&lt;unzip_directory&gt;/jboss-4.2.2.GA"
</pre>
            <p>
				</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
			Now that the JBoss Application Server has been successfully installed, we will download the source to the Mobicents Converged Application Server with Subversion, and build it.

      <p class="formalpara">
			</p>
      <div class="procedure">
        <a id="procedure-Downloading_the_Source_and_Building_Mobicents"></a>
        <ol class="1">
          <li>
            <p>
					First, move to the directory that you want to install Mobicents into, create a directory named <code class="filename">mobicents</code> into which you'll install everything, and then use Subversion to get the latest sources:
				</p>
            <pre class="screen">cd &lt;directory_to_install_mobicents_source_into&gt;
mkdir mobicents
svn co http://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/trunk mobicents
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
					Once Subversion has finished acquiring the latest revision of the sources, which may take a while, then we will then proceed to build Mobicents:
				</p>
            <pre class="screen">ant -f mobicents/core/build.xml
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 6 seconds
</pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
			TBD: Close with a sentence and direct the reader with a ulink to the Running Mobicents (which was installed from source) chapter. Issues that need to be addressed in this chapter include: installing GWT 1.3, which only comes in source for x86 (not version 1.4) and then building the management console.This chapter will have to be expanded with those instructions.
