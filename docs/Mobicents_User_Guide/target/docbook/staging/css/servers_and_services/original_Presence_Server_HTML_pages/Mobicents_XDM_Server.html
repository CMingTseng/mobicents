<p>Mobicents XDM Server is part of the Mobicents SIP Presence Service, it is the first free and open source implementation of a XML Document
Management Server, as defined in <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/release_program/xdm_v1_1.aspx">Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) XML Document Management v1.1 specification</a>. This functional element of new generation IP
communication networks, is responsible for handling the management of
user XML documents stored on the network side, such as presence
authorization rules, contact and group lists (also known as resource
lists), static presence information, and much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobicents XDM includes the following XCAP Application Usages:</p>
<ul>
<li>IETF pres-rules (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5025">RFC 5025</a>)<br>
</li>
<li>OMA pres-rules (<a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/release_program/Presence_simple_v1_1.aspx">OMA Presence Simple v1.1 Candidate Release</a>)<br>
</li>
<li>IETF resource-lists (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4826">RFC 4826</a>)<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure above depicts the functional architecture of the Mobicents XDM Server. It is composed of the following functional elements:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>The XDM Data Source is where all user XML documents are stored. Information related with the server itself, as the user's provisioned data, is also stored in this element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Data Source also handles subscriptions to updates on specific documents, or complete XCAP application usages. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Aggregation Proxy</h3>
<p>The aggregation proxy is responsible for handling XDM client's XCAP requests, which includes authentication and authorization of the requester.<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Request Processor</h3>
<p>This element includes the XCAP Server logic to process a XCAP request and return a proper response.<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>XDM Event Subscription Control</h3>
<p>This element is responsible for handling subscriptions, using SIP protocol, to changes in document managed by the XDM. It's functions includes the authentication and authorization of a subscription, attach to update events on specific documents or application usages, and the sending of notifications.<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation Architecture</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><a style="border: 0pt none ; background-color: transparent; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="/group/mobicents-public/web/XDMS%20Implementation.jpg"><img src="/group/mobicents-public/web/XDMS%20Implementation.jpg" style="border: 0pt none ;"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The XDM is built on top of Mobicents JAIN SLEE container. The figure above depicts the architecture of the XDM Server implementation:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Data Source Resource Adaptor</h3>
<p>This Resource Adaptor implements the Data Source functional element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RA Type defines two activities objects, DocumentActivity and AppUsageActivity, which are used to fire events that signal that a document,element or attribute were updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RA Type also defines a SBB RA interface to manage the users and documents stored in the XDM, and create activities, where events will be fired. The RA will only fire events on activities that exist, that is, the RA won't create activities implicitly, if a document is updated.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The RA Type also provides a base abstract implementation of the RA, making it very simple to change the underlying resource used to store information, which by default is the internal JDBC datasource of the JBoss Application Server.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>AppUsage Cache Resource Adaptor</h3>
<p>This Resource Adaptor stores the XCAP Application Usages installed in the server.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Each AppUsage is an object that includes the logic to validate XCAP documents that result from XCAP requests, and are expensive to create, thus the RA provides caching of AppUsages, using a pool model.</p>
<p> <br>
</p>
<p>The RA doesn't have events or activities.<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>AppUsage Service</h3>
<p>XCAP Application Usages are installed through a&nbsp; JAIN SLEE service, making it possible to add/remove application usages with the server running.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Aggregation Proxy Service</h3>
<p>This JAIN SLEE service implements the&nbsp; Aggregation Proxy functional element. It handles events fired by the Mobicents HTTP Servlet Resource Adaptor, and then uses two child SBBs: the User Profile Enabler SBB to retrieve information regarding the user needed for authentication/authorization of the XCAP request, and the Request Processor SBB to handle the XCAP request.&nbsp;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Request Processor SBB</h3>
<p>The Request Processor SBB implements the Request Processor functional element, providing a synchronous SBB interface to process XCAP requests. It uses the AppUsage Cache RA to&nbsp; borrow&nbsp; AppUsage objects, and the DataSource RA to&nbsp; retrieve or set documents stored in the server's data source. <br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>User Profile Enabler SBB (not available yet)<br>
</h3>
<p>This SBB provides a synchronous SBB interface, to use in JAIN SLEE child relations, to retrieve user information. Two different implementations of the interface are provided, one considers that the information is stored in the XDM Data Source, another interfaces to a Diameter Sh Server such as IMS HSS. <br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>XCAP Diff Subscription Control Service (not available yet)<br>
</h3>
<p>TODO&nbsp;</p>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
The implementation architecture figure also contains all client side components:
<ul>
<li>
<h3>XCAP Client</h3>
<p>The XCAP Client is a simple API to interact with a XCAP Server, that internally uses Apache HTTP Client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The API documentation and example code snippets can be found <a href="/group/mobicents-public/web/xcap-client-api">here</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>XCAP Client Resource Adaptor</h3>
<p>The XCAP Client Resource Adaptor adapts the XCAP Client API into JAIN SLEE domain. It provides methods to interact with the XCAP server in both syncronous and asyncronous ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RA Type description and code snippets using the RA can be found <a href="/group/mobicents-public/web/xcap-client-resource-adaptor">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>XDM Client SBB</h3>
<p>The XDMClientSBB is an interface of a JAIN SLEE SBB to be used
as a client to the Mobicents XDM Server (and others compliant with
same standards), in JAIN SLEE child relations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two
implementations of this interface are provided, the
InternalXDMClientSBB, that is to be used on applications running
in the Mobicents XDM Server JAIN SLEE container, and the
ExternalXDMClientSBB, to be used on applications running in a
different JAIN SLEE container than the Mobicents XDM Server.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Server setup and testing<br>
</h2>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The Mobicents XDM Server can be customized before built:</p>
<ul>
<li>XCAP Root, through property xdm.server.xcap.root in pom.xml inside the Mobicents Presence Service root directory (/trunk/servers/sip-presence), defines the relative path to root that is considered the XCAP Root for all XCAP URIs. Must match the servlet name used in Mobicents HTTP Servlet RA. Default value is <b>/mobicents</b>.<br>
</li>
<li>Dynamic user provisioning, through property dynamicUserProvisioning in pom.xml inside the Mobicents Presence Service root directory
(/trunk/servers/sip-presence), defines if the XDM Server should provision the user when a PUT request is being processed and the user is not installed for the request's application usage. Default value is <b>true</b>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no configuration needed to deploy the server.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>The Mobicents XDM Server depends on Mobicents JAIN SLEE server and Mobicents SIP and HTTP Servlet resource adaptors, ensure all are installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment, the Mobicents XDM Server is not compatible with JDK 1.6&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Install/Uninstall</h3>
<p>From source code repository, install doing <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">mvn install</span> on directory /trunk/servers/sip-presence/xdms, uninstall doing <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">mvn clean</span> on same directory.<br>
</p>
<p>Using a binary release, install doing <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">ant deploy</span> on directory servers/sip-presence/xdms, uninstall doing <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">ant undeploy</span> on same directory.</p>
<h3>Testing&nbsp;</h3>
<p>After server is deployed, it is recommended to test it. Please lookup for further instructions in file .../xdms/tests/README.txt. No test should fail.<br>
