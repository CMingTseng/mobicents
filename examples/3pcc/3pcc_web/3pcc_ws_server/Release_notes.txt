Release notes

Features and known limitations:
 
* Supports sip URIs on the form sip:username@domain:port and sip:username@ipaddress:port 
(other such as sips URIs has not been tested)

* Implements a ParlayX interface

* Publishes the following four services:

  makeCall - sets up the call between two SIP parties
  cancelCallRequest - cancel an ingoing call setup procedure
  endCall - ends the call between the two SIP parties
  getCallInformation - get call status during the whole call session; during setup, ongoing call and tear down procedure.
  	
* There is a bug in the web server that makes the getCallInformation() throwing an IllegalStateException. 
The cause of this problem is yet to be found! A strange thing about this problem is that it only occurs 
when called by the client invoker (se.jayway.sip.callcontrol.client.invoker.ThirdPartyCallInvoker)! 
It works perfectly ok when called from inside the servlet in the web app!
