/**
 * The <code>Sbb</code> interface is implemented by every Service Building Block (SBB)
 * abstract class.  Every SBB must include an SBB abstract class.  The SLEE uses the
 * methods defined in this interface to notify SBB objects of lifecycle events.
 * <p>
 * <b>Additional method declarations</b>
 * <br>
 * An SBB developer may define or implement a number of additional methods that follow
 * certain design patterns.  These are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Methods invoked by the SLEE on an SBB object:
 *     <ul>
 *     <li><b>Event-handler methods:</b>
 *         <br>
 *         Event handler methods are implemented in the SBB abstract class with the
 *         following signature:
 *         <p>
 *         <ul><code>public void on<i>&lt;event-name&gt;</i>(<i>&lt;event-class-name&gt;</i> event,
 *         <i>&lt;activity-context-interface-name&gt;</i> aci) { ... }</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         where:
 *         <ul>
 *           <code><i>event-name</i></code> is the name of the event given in the SBB's deployment
 *           descriptor.
 *           <br>
 *           <code><i>event-class-name</i></code> is the class name of event objects of the
 *           repective event type.
 *           <br>
 *           <code><i>activity-context-interface-name</i></code> is the name of the Activity
 *           Context Interface used by the SBB, as defined in the SBB's deployment descriptor.
 *         </ul><p>
 *         Event-handler methods are invoked with a valid transaction context on an SBB in the Ready state.
 *         <p>
 *     <li><b>Initial event selector method:</b>
 *         <br>
 *         This method is invoked on an SBB object in the Pooled state.  It allows the SBB
 *         to determine the selection criteria for the convergence name variables used in
 *         event routing.  The initial event selector method has the following signature:
 *         <p>
 *         <ul><code>public InitialEventSelector <i>&lt;method-name&gt;</i>(InitialEventSelector ies) { ... }</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         where:
 *         <ul>
 *           <code><i>method-name</i></code> is the name of the method as defined in the SBB's
 *           deployment descriptor.
 *         </ul><p>
 *         Initial event selector methods are invoked on an SBB in the Pooled state with an
 *         unspecified transaction context.
 *     </ul>
 *   <li>Methods invoked by SBB objects.  These methods are all abstract and are implemented by the SLEE
 *       when the SBB is deployed.  These methods are all transactional, and will throw a
 *       <code>javax.slee.TransactionRequiredLocalException</code> if invoked without a valid transaction
 *       context.  Additionally, methods other than CMP field accessors can only be invoked by an SBB object
 *       that has been assigned to an SBB entity.  If the SBB object is not assigned to an SBB entity, a
 *       <code>java.lang.IllegalStateException</code> is thrown.  These methods may also throw a
 *       <code>javax.slee.SLEEException</code> if the operation could not be successfully completed due to
 *       a system-level failure.
 *     <ul>
 *     <li><b>CMP field accessor methods:</b>
 *         <br>
 *          A CMP field is defined in the SBB abstract class using methods with the following signatures:
 *          <p>
 *          <ul><code>public abstract void set<i>&lt;field-name&gt;</i>(<i>&lt;field-type&gt;</i> value);<br>
 *                    public abstract <i>&lt;field-type&gt;</i> get&lt;field-name&gt;();</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         where:
 *         <ul>
 *           <code><i>field-type</i></code> is the Java type of the CMP field.
 *           <br>
 *           <code><i>field-name</i></code> is the name of the CMP field as declared in the SBB's deployment
 *           descriptor, with the first letter capitalized.
 *         </ul><p>
 *     <li><b>Fire-event methods:</b>
 *         <br>
 *         Methods that the SBB uses to fire events into the SLEE are defined in the SBB
 *         abstract class with the following signature:
 *         <p>
 *         <ul><code>public abstract void fire<i>&lt;event-name&gt;</i>(<i>&lt;event-class-name&gt;</i> event,
 *         ActivityContextInterface aci, Address defautAddress);</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         where:
 *         <ul>
 *           <code><i>event-name</i></code> is the name of the event given in the SBB's
 *           deployment descriptor.
 *           <br>
 *           <code><i>event-class-name</i></code> is the class name of event objects of the
 *           repective event type.
 *         </ul><p>
 *     <li><b>Activity Context Interface narrow method:</b>
 *         <br>
 *         This method is only be defined in the SBB abstract class if the SBB uses an
 *         Activity Context Interface other than <code>javax.slee.ActivityContextInterface</code>.
 *         This method allows the SBB to obtain an object that implements the SBB's Activity
 *         Context Inteface from an object that implements the generic
 *         <code>javax.slee.ActivityContextInterface</code>.  If declared, the method's
 *         signature must be:
 *         <p>
 *         <ul><code>public abstract <i>&lt;activity-context-interface-name&gt;</i>
 *         asSbbActivityContextInterface(ActivityContextInterface aci);</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         where:
 *         <ul>
 *           <code><i>activity-context-interface-name</i></code> is the name of the Activity
 *           Context Interface used by the SBB, as defined in the SBB's deployment descriptor.
 *         </ul><p>
 *     <li><b>Child relation accessor methods:</b>
 *         <br>
 *         For each child relation the SBB has, a method with the following signature must be
 *         declared:
 *         <p>
 *         <ul><code>public abstract ChildRelation <i>&lt;method-name&gt;</i>();</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         where:
 *         <ul>
 *           <code><i>method-name</i></code> is the name of the child relation method as defined
 *           in the SBB's deployment descriptor.
 *         </ul><p>
 *     <li><b>Profile CMP Interface accessor methods:</b>
 *         <br>
 *         For each profile specification used by the SBB, the SBB abstract class may declare
 *         a method with the following signature:
 *         <p>
 *         <ul><code>public abstract <i>&lt;profile-CMP-interface-name&gt;</i>
 *             <i>&lt;method-name&gt;</i>(ProfileID id) throws
 *             javax.slee.profile.UnrecognizedProfileTableNameException,
 *             javax.slee.profile.UnrecognizedProfileNameException;</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         where:
 *         <ul>
 *           <code><i>profile-CMP-interface-name</i></code> is the name of the profile's
 *           CMP interface.
 *           <br>
 *           <code><i>method-name</i></code> is the name of the profile CMP accessor method as defined
 *           in the SBB's deployment descriptor.
 *         </ul><p>
 *     <li><b>Usage Parameter Interface accessor methods:</b>
 *         <br>
 *         These two methods are only defined in the SBB abstract class if the SBB defines a
 *         Usage Parameter Interface.  The first method provides access to the SBB's unnamed
 *         usage parameter set while the second provides access to a named usage parameter set.
 *         <p>
 *         <ul><code>public abstract <i>&lt;usage-parameters-interface-name&gt;</i>
 *             getDefaultSbbUsageParameterSet();</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         <ul><code>public abstract <i>&lt;usage-parameters-interface-name&gt;</i>
 *             getSbbUsageParameterSet(String paramSetName) throws
 *             javax.slee.usage.UnrecognizedUsageParameterSetNameException;</code></ul>
 *         <p>
 *         where:
 *         <ul>
 *           <code><i>usage-parameters-interface-name</i></code> is the name of the SBB's usage
 *           parameter interface.
