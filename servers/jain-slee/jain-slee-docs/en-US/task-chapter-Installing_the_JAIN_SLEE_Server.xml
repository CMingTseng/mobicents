	<para>The Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server can be installed by downloading the ready-to-go binary distribution</para>
	<para>Alternatively, the source code can be obtained using the Subversion version control system (<acronym>VCS</acronym>) and then can be built from source. Installing the binary distribution is recommended for most users, and obtaining and building the source code distribution is recommended for those who want access to the latest revisions and capabilities. This guide only details how to install, run and configure the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server from the ready-to-go binary distribution.</para>

			<title>Downloading</title>
			<para>When you download the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server binary distribution, you can also choose to verify the integrity of the zip file you download, which is both preferred and safer. If you are setting up the server in a production environment (as opposed to, say, merely playing around with the JAIN SLEE Server's capabilities on your personal machine), we recommend verifying the integrity of the downloaded distribution. The first procedure following shows you how to simply download the JAIN SLEE Server binary distribution, while the second procedure following details how to download <emphasis>and</emphasis> verify the installation zip file.</para>
			<procedure>
				<title>Downloading Without Verifying</title>
				<step>
					<para>You can download the latest version of the  JAIN SLEE Server from <ulink
							url="http://www.mobicents.org/jainsleedownload.html"/>. Look for this paragraph at the top of the page: <quote>The latest release of Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server is &JSS_VERSION; and recommended one. Browse all files <emphasis>here</emphasis>
					</quote>.</para>
				</step>
			</procedure>
			<procedure>
				<title>Downloading and Verifying</title>
				<step>
					<para>The preferred&#x2014;and safer&#x2014;way to obtain the JAIN SLEE Server binary distribution is to download the binary zip file as well as its corresponding SHA-1 file, and to use the SHA-1 file to verify the integrity of the zip file. To do this, first go to <ulink
							url="http://www.mobicents.org/jainsleedownload.html"/> and, at the top of the page, click on the <guilabel>here</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Browse all files here</guilabel> link <emphasis>for the JAIN SLEE Server</emphasis>. The most recent releases are located near the top, but make sure that you don't select an alpha release, such as the JAIN SLEE Server version 2.0.0. <emphasis>ALPHA</emphasis> release<footnote><para>This guide is for the 1.2-series of Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server releases.</para>
						</footnote>. Download both the zip file and its attendant SHA-1 file. For example, if you wanted to download the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server version 1.2.3 GA (suggested), you would want to download both of the following files:</para>
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>&JSS_ZIP;</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>&JSS_ZIP;.sha1.asc</para>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Next, verify the integrity of the zip file with the SHA-1 file, which contains a checksum which is used to do precisely this, to alert you if the file has been changed since it was uploaded, or if it was corrupted upon download.</para>
					<para>On a Linux system you can use the <command>sha1sum</command> command to verify the integrity of the binary distribution zip file.</para>
					<para>On a Windows system you will need to download a sha1sum-generating program such as the <command>sha1sum.exe</command> program. This program will generate a checksum that you can compare with the sum in the sha1 file.</para>
					<para>If the two checksums are identical, then the downloaded binary distribution zip file's integrity is assured, and it is safe to proceed with the installation.</para>
					<warning>
						<title>Beware of a Corrupted or Compromised Zip File!</title>
						<para>If the two checksums are <emphasis>not</emphasis> identical, it means that the downloaded zip file was corrupted upon download, or has been changed since it was last uploaded to the server. In this case, you should first re-download the two files (the zip file and the SHA-1 file) and compare them once more. If this second comparison fails, it could indicate a problem with the install file, and you should contact the Mobicents team by email (see <!--<xref linkend="Author_Group"/>-->) to alert them of the conflict.</para>

				<title>Installing the JAIN SLEE Server Binary Distribution on Linux</title>
				<step>
					<para>Assuming that you downloaded the binary distribution zip file to your home folder, create a subdirectory to unzip hte files to. It is good practice to include the version number in this directory name; if you do so, remember to correctly match it with the version of the binary distribution you downloaded.</para>
				 <!-- ~]$ mkdir "jss-<replaceable><version></replaceable>" -->
					<screen
						condition="jbcp">~]$ mkdir &quot;jss-<replaceable>&lt;version&gt;</replaceable>&quot;</screen>

					<screen
						condition="mob">~]$ cd &quot;jss-&lt;version&gt;&quot;</screen>

				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Finally, use Java's <command>jar <option>-xvf</option>

					<stepalternatives>
						<step>
							<para>Alternatively, if Linux's <command>unzip</command> utility is present on your system or is installable, you can use it in lieu of Java's <command>jar <option>-xvf</option>

			<procedure>
				<title>Installing the JAIN SLEE Server Binary Distribution on Windows</title>
				<step>
					<para>For this example, we'll assume that you downloaded the binary distribution zip file to the <filename>My Downloads</filename> folder. First, using Windows Explorer, create a subfolder in <filename>My Downloads</filename> to extract the zip file's contents into. When you name this folder, it is good practice to include the version number; if you do so, remember to correctly match it with the version of the JAIN SLEE Server binary distribution you downloaded. In these instructions, we will refer to this folder as <filename>jss-<replaceable>&lt;version&gt;</replaceable>
					</filename>.</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Double-click the downloaded zip file, selecting as the destination folder the one you just created to hold the zip file's contents.</para>
					<stepalternatives>
						<step>
							<para>Alternatively, it is also possible to use Java's <command>jar <option>-xvf</option>
									</command> command to extract the binary distribution files from the zip archive. To use this method instead, first move the downloaded zip file from <filename>My Downloads</filename> to the folder that you just created to hold the JAIN SLEE Server files.</para>
						</step>
						<step>
							<para>Then, open the Windows Command Prompt and navigate to the folder holding the archive using the <command>cd</command> command:</para>
							<note
								id="itjss-Opening_the_Command_Prompt_from_Windows_Explorer">
								<title>Opening the Command Prompt from Windows Explorer</title>
								<para>If you are using Windows Vista&#xAE;, you can open the Command Prompt directly from Explorer. Hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key and right-click on either a folder, the desktop, or inside a folder. This will cause an <guimenuitem>Open Command Window Here</guimenuitem> context menu item to appear, which can be used to open the Command Prompt with the current working directory set to either the folder you opened, or opened it from.</para>

							<screen
								condition="mob">C:\Users\Me&gt;cd &quot;My Downloads\jss-&lt;version&gt;&quot;</screen>

						</step>
						<step>
							<para>Finally, use the <command>jar <option>-xvf</option>
									</command> command to extract the archive contents into the current folder.</para>
							 <!-- C:\Users\Me\My Downloads\jss-<replaceable><version></replaceable>>jar -xvf "&JSS_ZIP;" -->

						</step>
					</stepalternatives>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>At this point, you may want to move the folder holding the JAIN SLEE Server binary files (in this example, the folder named <filename>jss-<replaceable>&lt;version&gt;</replaceable>
						</filename>) to another location. This step is not strictly necessary, but it is probably a good idea to move the Mobicents folder from <filename>My Downloads</filename> to a user-defined location for storing runnable programs. Any location will suffice, however.</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>You may also want to delete the zip file after extracting its contents in order to free disk space:</para>
					 <!-- C:\Users\Me\My Downloads\jss-<replaceable><version></replaceable>>delete "&JSS_ZIP;" -->
					<screen
						condition="jbcp">C:\Users\Me\My Downloads\jss-<replaceable>&lt;version&gt;</replaceable>&gt;delete &quot;&JSS_ZIP;&quot;</screen>
