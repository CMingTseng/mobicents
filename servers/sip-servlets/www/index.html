The JAIN-SIP implementation from http://jain-sip.dev.java.net will be used as the SIP stack and Mobicents will be used as the SLEE implementation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the <a title="implementation tasks" target="_blank" href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dfcjr48z_65gpwxnz">implementation tasks</a>  needed to implement the JSR 289 spec.
