/**
 * This box within a Media Box declares the process by which the media-data in 
 * the track is presented, and thus, the nature of the media in a track. 
 * For example, a video track would be handled by a video handler.
 * This box when present within a Meta Box, declares the structure or format of 
 * the meta box contents. There is a general handler for metadata streams 
 * of any type; the specific format is identified by the sample entry, as for 
 * video or audio, for example. If they are in text, then a MIME format is 
 * supplied to document their format; if in XML, each sample is a complete 
 * XML document, and the namespace of the XML is also supplied.

 * 
 * Box Type: hdlr
 * Container: Media Box (mdia) or Meta Box (meta)
 * Mandatory: Yes
 * Quantity: Exactly one
