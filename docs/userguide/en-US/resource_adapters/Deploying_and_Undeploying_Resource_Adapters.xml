		<title>Before You Begin: Resource Adapters and Deployable Unit Files</title>
		<para>Resource adapters are JAIN SLEE components that can be deployed (i.e. <quote>loaded</quote> or <quote>installed</quote>) into the Mobicents Converged Application Server, and undeployed (<quote>uninsntalled</quote>) from it. At the file level, resource adapters consist of specially-named files called deployable unit files. Two of these deployable unit files must be loaded/installed before the Mobicents Converged Application Server will deploy the resource adapter. The next few sections will teach you how to locate where resource adapters and their files live, and how to deploy them and undeploy them through several different, though equivalent ways: via the command line; by copying the correct files to a special directory, or removing them from it; or with the Mobicents Management Console.</para>
		<para>Which of these various ways of accomplishing the same task is easier depends on you. If you are comfortable with the command line, or like to script behavior, then deploying via the command line will probably be the preferred way for you. If you would prefer to simply copy or delete some files with the file manager, you can do it that way. And for those who prefer graphical user interfaces (<acronym>GUI</acronym>s), the Management Console provides an interface to the Mobicents Converged Application Server, and can easily be used to accomplish such tasks both locally and remotely. However&mdash;no matter which method you eventually choose, it will be necessary to read the following explanatory paragraphs, on where to find the directories corresponding to the resource adapters you want to install, and on how to recognize deployable unit files, before reading any or all of the method sections.</para>

			<para>The files belonging to resource adapters, and which you will need to access in order to deploy and undeplay them, are located in <filename><replaceable>&lt;topmost_mobicents_directory&gt;</replaceable>/resources</filename>. It is trivial to figure out which directory in <filename>resources</filename> corresponds to the resource adapter that you wish to deploy or undeploy. For example, the <filename>sipra</filename> directory holds the files necessary for running the <acronym>SIP</acronym> resource adapter, and the <filename>xmppra</filename> directory holds the <acronym>XMPP</acronym> and Google Talk resource adapter.</para>

			<para>Deployable unit files are <acronym>JAR</acronym> (Java ARchive) files. There are two deployable unit files in each resource adapter's directory. The following two patterns describe the file names:</para>
