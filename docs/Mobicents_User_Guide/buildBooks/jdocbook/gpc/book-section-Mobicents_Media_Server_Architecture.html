               <p>Media services have played an important role in the traditional Time Division Multiplexing (<acronym class="acronym">TDM</acronym>)-based telephone network. As the network migrates to an Internet Protocol (<acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym>)-based environment, media services are also moving to new environments.</p>
               <p>One of the most exciting trends is the emergence and adoption of complementary modular standards that leverage the Internet to enable media services to be developed, deployed and updated more rapidly than before in a network architecture that supports the two concepts we will call provisioning-on-demand and scaling-on-demand.</p>

                  <h5 class="formalpara">General Design Overview</h5>
                  <p class="formalpara">Mobicents Media Server is developed on top of existing Java technologies. The Java platform is the ideal platform for network computing. It offers a single, unifying programming model that can connect all elements of a business infrastructure. The modularization effort is supported by the use of the Java Management Extension (<acronym class="acronym">JMX</acronym>) <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>, and the industry-standard Service Logic Execution Environment (<acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym>) container. Using JMX enables easy management of both the server's media components and the control modules hosted by <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym>.</p>
                  <p>This high degree of modularity benefits the application developer in several ways. The already-tight code can be further trimmed down to support applications that must have small footprints. For example, if <acronym class="acronym">PSTN</acronym> (Public Switched Telephone Network) interconnection is unnecessary in your application, then simply take the D-channel feature out of the server. If you later decide to deploy the same application within a Signaling System 7 (<acronym class="acronym">SS7</acronym>) network, then simply enable the appropriate endpoint. Another example is the freedom you have to drop your favorite media control protocol directly into the <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> container.</p>

                  <p>The components that are involved in media processing or endpoints are implemented with <acronym class="acronym">JMF</acronym>, the Java Media Framework. JMF provides a platform-neutral framework for displaying time-sensitive media. The <acronym class="acronym">JMF</acronym>

                        </li>

                           <p>Scales across different types of media data</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Provides an event model for asynchnronous communication between JMF and applications or applets</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>The <acronym class="acronym">JMF</acronym> architecture allows advanced developers nto create and integrate new types of controllers and data sources. The <acronym class="acronym">JMF</acronym> 
                     <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> declares abstract interfaces which are used for handling new media sources and sinks such as audio and video files, <acronym class="acronym">PSTN</acronym> cards, webcams, etc.</p>
                  <p>The Media Server architecture assumes that call control intelligence is outside of the Media Server and handled by an external entity. The Mebia Server assumes that call controllers will use control procedures such as <acronym class="acronym">MGCP</acronym>, Mecago or <acronym class="acronym">MSML</acronym>, among others. Each specific control module can be plugged in directly to the server as a standard <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> deployable unit. The usage of a <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> container for the implementation of the control protocol-specific communication logic provides simple deployment and also the easy deployment of such control modules. The developer will not have to mess with low-level transaction and state management details, multi-threading, connection-pooling and other similar complex, low-level <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>s.</p>

                     <p>The Mobicents Media Server uses <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> for implementing its own communication capabilities. The <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> container doesn't serve here as a call controller.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>In addition to control protocol modules, the <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> container is aimed at providing high-level features like Interactive Voice Response (<acronym class="acronym">IVR</acronym>) and Drools or VoiceXML engines.</p>
                  <p>The modules deployed under <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> control interact with the Media Server Service Provider Interface (<acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym>) through the Media Server Control Resource Adapter, or <acronym class="acronym">MSC-RA</acronym>. The <acronym class="acronym">MSC-RA</acronym> follows the recommendations of JSR-309 and implements asynchronous interconnection with the Media Server <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym> stack. This local implementation is restricted and does not all the use of high-level abstractions like VoiceXML dialogs, <abbr class="abbrev">etc.</abbr>.</p>
                  <h5 class="formalpara">Typical Deployment Scenario</h5>
                  <p class="formalpara">Mobicents Media Server offers a complete solution for all aspects of being a media gateway and server.

                  <p class="formalpara">It is convenient to consider a media gateway as a collection of endpoints. An endpoint is a logical representation of a physical entity such as an analog phone or a channel in a trunk. Endpoints are sources or sinks of data and can be physical or virtual. Physical endpoint creation requires hardware installation whil esoftware is sufficient for creating a virtual endpoint. An interface on a gateway that terminates a trunk connected to a PSTN switch is an example of a physical endpoint. An audio source in an audio content server is an example of a virtual endpoint.</p>
                  <p>The type of the endpoint determines its functionality. Our analysis, so far, has led us to isolate the following basic endpoint types:</p>

                  <p class="formalpara">This endpoint contains a set of resources which provide the media-processing functionality. It manages the interconnection of media streams between the resources, and arbitrates the flow of media stream data between them. Media servicesor commands are invoked by a client application on the endpoint; that endpoint causes the resources to perform the desired services, and directs events sent by the resources to the appropriate client. The resources in the endpoint include a primary resource and zero or more secondary resources. The primary resource is typically connected to an external media stream, and provides the data from that stream to the secondary resources. The secondary resources may process that stream (<abbr class="abbrev">e.g.</abbr> by recording it and/or performing automatic speech recognition on it), or may themselves generate generate media stream data (<abbr class="abbrev">e.g.</abbr> by playing a voice file) which is then transmitted to the primary resource.</p>
                  <p>A resource is statically prepared if the preparation takes place at the time of creation. A resource is dynamically prepared if preparation of a particular resource (and its associated media streams) does not occur until it is required by a media operation. Static preparation can lead to less efficient usage of a server's resources, because resources may tend to be allocated for a longer time before use. However, once a resource has been prepared, it is guaranteed to be available for use. Dynamic preparation may utilize resources more efficiently because of Just-In-Time (<acronym class="acronym">JIT</acronym>) allocation algorithms may be used.</p>
                  <p>An endpoint is divided logically into a Service Provider Interface (<acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym>) that is used to implement specific a endpoint, and a management interface which is used for implementing manageable resources of that endpoint. All endpoints are plugged into the Mobicents <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> server by registering with the MBean server. The kernel in that sense is only an aggregator, and not a source of actual functionality. The functionality is provided by the <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym> implementation of the Mbeans, and in fact, all major endpoints are manageable MBeans interconnected through the MBean server. The best way to add endpoints to a Media Server is to write a new <acronym class="acronym">JMX</acronym> bean which provides implementation of the endpoint's <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym>.</p>
                  <p>The <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym> layer is an abstraction that endpoint providers must implement to enable their media-processing features. An implementation of <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym> for an endpoint is referred to as an <span class="emphasis">

                  <p>The resources allocated to a connection, and more generally the handling of the connection, are chosen by the media server under instructions from the call agent.  The call agent will provide these  instructions by sending two set of parameters to the media server:</p>

                     <a name="itemlist-Two_Sets_of_Parameters"/>

                  </div>
                  <p>The local directives specify such parameters as the mode of the connection (e.g. send only, send-receive), preferred coding or packetization methods, usage of echo cancellation or silence suppression.  (A detailed list can be found in the specification of   the LocalConnectionOptions parameter of the CreateConnection command.) For each of these parameters, the call agent can either specify a value, a range of value, or no value at all.  This allow various implementations to implement various level of control, from a very tight control where the call agent specifies minute details of   the connection handling to a very loose control where the call agent only specifies broad guidelines, such as the maximum bandwidth, and let the gateway choose the detailed values.</p>
                  <p>Based on the value of the local directives, the gateway will determine the resources allocated to the connection.  When this is possible, the gateway will choose values that are in line with the remote session description - but there is no absolute requirement that the parameters be exactly the same.</p>
                  <p>Once the resource have been allocated, the gateway will compose a "session description" that describes the way it intends to receive packets.  Note that the session description may in some cases present a range of values.  For example, if the gateway is ready to accept one of several compression algorithm, it can provide a list of these accepted algorithms.</p>

                  <p>The concept of events and signals is central to the Media Server.  A Call Controller may ask to be notified about certain events occurring in an endpoint  (e.g., off-hook events) by passing event's identifier as parameter to endpoint's subscribe(...) method.</p>
                  <p>A Call Controller may also request certain signals to be applied to an endpoint (e.g., dial-tone) by supplying the identifier of the event in as argument to endpoint's apply(...) method.</p>
                  <p>Events and signals are grouped in packages, within which they share the same name space which we will refer to as event identifier in the following. Event identifiers are integer constants. Some of the events may be parametrized with additional data such as DTMF mask.</p>

If the signal is not stopped, the signal will time out, stop and generate an "operation complete" event, about which the server controller may or may not have requested to be notified.  A TO signal that fails after being started, but before having generated an "operation complete" event will generate an "operation failure" event which will include the name of the signal that failed.

As an example, a brief tone could be a DTMF digit. If the DTMF digit "1" is currently being played, and a signal stopping event occurs, the "1" would play to completion.
