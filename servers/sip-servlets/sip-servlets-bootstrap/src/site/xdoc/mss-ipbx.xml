		<section name="Description">
			<p>
				The Media IPBX project is based on the Seam Sip Servlets framework and it's goal is
				 to demonstrate the technology and eventually become a real useful PBX product. The
				  primary design requirements for the PBX are:
				<br/>
			</p>
					<ul>
				<li>To have a dynamic Web GUI where users can log in, manipulate and monitor the call status, adjust system or profile settings and so on</li>
				<li>To allow proxy-mode and all other classic PBX operations without the need to use the Web GUI</li>
				<li>To be extensible and customizable</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
								Currently the PBX terminates all calls in Mobicents Media Server conference endpoints,
				 which allows maximum flexibility to manipulate the calls after they are established. 
				 This allows features like server-side conferencing, ringback tones, later voicemail and 
				 call recording will be added. Another application of the PBX is to act as Session Border Controller.
				 <a style="color:red">For now the PBX runs only on Mobicents Sip Servlets with JBoss AS 4.2.3</a>

		<section name="Downloading">
			You can download the binaries from here <a href="http://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/downloads/list/ipbx.zip">here</a>, unzip it and  drop it into JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy directory.
			The PBX needs a data source, a default datasource is provided in the zip file, but you can configure your own as well.
		</section>
		<section name="Building and installing">
		You can download the source code from <a href="http://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/servers/sip-servlets/sip-servlets-seam/ipbx/">here</a>.
			First you need SVN, Ant and Maven  properly configured on your system.
			<ul>
			<li>Do <code>http://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/servers/sip-servlets/sip-servlets-seam/ipbx/</code></li>
			
			<li>Set your JBOSS_HOME to a location where Mobicents Sip Servlets 7.2 or later is installed. The simply run:</li>
			</ul><br/><code>
			ant clean all
			</code><br/>
		</section>	
		<section name="Usage">
			Once the PBX is installed and running navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/ipbx">http://localhost:8080/ipbx</a> and follow the instructions.
			Please note that there is a known bug when you try to add a Phone from the GUI - the first operations succeeds, then secon two attempts will fail
			(and the GUI will ask you to try again), after that no problems are expected. We are working towards solving this and other annoying issues, mostly
			 related to the Database. And any help in this or other aspects are welcome!
