/**
 * The RAFActivity object models a statemachine (activity) controlled by the resource 
 * adaptor. In the case of RAFrame resource adaptor the activity / statemachine is quite
 * simple. The RAFrame resource adaptor accepts a simple message based protocol. The 
 * various protocol messages are embedded into a dialog.
 * <br>
 * The message format / protocol contains an id and a command. 
 * Normally, the message format looks like:<br>
 * id command<br>
 * e.g.<br>
 * 100 INIT<br>
 * <br>
 * The message format is embedded in a "protocol".<br>
 * The very first message in a "dialog" is the "100 INIT" command. It initiates
 * the "dialog". Here, the "dialog" for id 100 is initiated.<br>
 * The next message in a valid "dialog" is any number of "100 ANY" commands. They
 * continue the "dialog". Here, the "dialog" for id 100 is continued.<br>
 * The terminating message is the "100 END" command. It terminates the "dialog". 
 * Here the "dialog" for id 100 ends. 
 * <br>
 * The statemachine for the resource adaptor looks like this:
 *
 *  -------------           ---------          -------
 * | NOTEXISTING |--INIT-->| ACTIVE  |--END-->| ENDED |
 *  -------------           ---------          -------
 *                          ^     |
 *                          |     |
 *                           -ANY-
 * Valid is: 
 *          State NOTEXISTING ACTIVE ENDED
 * Command  INIT       X        -     -
 *          ANY        -        X     -
 *          END        -        X     -
 *
 * Invalid protocol messages are simply skipped.
 * <br>
 * The RAFActivity is referenced in the deployment descriptor file 
 * "resource-adapter-type-jar.xml" in the tag <activity-type>, sub-tag 
 * <activity-type-name>: com.maretzke.raframe.RAFActivity.
 * <br>
 * For further information, please refer to JAIN SLEE Specification 1.0, Final 
 * Release Page 238 and Page 240.
