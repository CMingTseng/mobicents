Features and known limitations

*Authentication support for INVITE but not for BYE. 
This means that the app does not work with proxies that require authentication 
for BYE.

* Support for termination and cancelling by means of custom events.

* State sharing via JNDI. This is not a recommended solution and will be replaced.

* Incomplete exception handling in some cases. Not severe for demo purposes but this should be 
amended to provide an example of best practices.

* Metrics via usage parameters, see jmx-console --> 'slee'.
