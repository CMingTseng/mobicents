		<procedure
			id="procedure-Downloading_and_Verifying_the_Mobicents_Distribution">
			<step>
				<para>First, Download the latest version of the Mobicents binary distribution. The latest version can be found by going to the <ulink
						url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mobicents/">Mobicents project page on SourceForge.net</ulink>, clicking on <emphasis>Download Mobicents</emphasis>, and then looking for <emphasis>Mobicents Server</emphasis> and <emphasis>Latest Version</emphasis>.</para>
			</step>
			<step>
				<para>Then verify the integrity of the zip file. Along with the zip file there is a sha1 file<footnote><para>For the Mobicents 1.20 binary release, the relevant file names are <filename>mobicents-all-1_2_0_BETA1.zip</filename> and <filename>mobicents-all-1_2_0_BETA1.zip.sha1.asc</filename>.</para>
					</footnote> which contains a checksum that can be used to verify the integrity of the zip file, and can alert you if the file has been changed since it was uploaded, or if it was corrupted upon download.</para>
				<para>On a Linux system you can use the <command>sha1sum</command> command to verify the integrity of the binary distribution zip file.</para>
				<para>On a Windows system you will need to download a sha1sum-generating program such as the <command>sha1sum.exe</command> program. This will generate a checksum that you can compare with the sum in the sha1 file.</para>
				<para>Note that if the two checksums are not identical, it means that the downloaded zip file was corrupted upon download, or has been changed since it was last uploaded to the server.</para>
			</step>
			<step>
				<para>Finally, install the Mobicents Converged Application Server. Unzip the Mobicents binary distribution zip file to a location in your home directory, thus completing the install.</para>

			<title>Downloading and Installing the Jboss Binary Distribution</title>
			<para>Once the pre-install requirements have been met, you are ready to start. We will split the entire procedure, which isn't long but may take a while depending on the speed of your Internet connection, into two parts: in the first we will install JBoss; in the second, we will download and build Mobicents.</para>

		<procedure

			<title>Downloading and Installing JBoss</title>
			<step>
				<para>First, move to the directory that you want to install JBoss into, and download the JBoss 4.2.2 General Availability (<acronym>GA</acronym>) binary distribution <footnote
						id="jboss_sourceforge_link"><para>If the given direct link to JBoss 4.2.2 <acronym>GA</acronym> doesn't work for you, try instead to find the binary JBoss distribution here, <ulink

<command>cd <filename><replaceable>&lt;directory_to_install_jboss_into&gt;</replaceable>

					<command>wget http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/jboss/jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip</command>
				</screen>
			</step>
			<step>
				<para>Next, assuming you want to install JBoss in the same directory you downloaded the zip file distribution to, unzip it:</para>
				<screen>
<command>unzip jboss-4.2.2.GA.zip</command>
				</screen>
			</step>
			<step>
				<para>Finally, we must set the <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable. The quick-and-easy way to set it for the current session, but which will not last beyond the next reboot, is to <command>export</command> the variable on the command line, and then to <command>echo</command> the variable to make sure that it contains the right directory. For example:</para>
				<screen>
<command>export JBOSS_HOME=&quot;${PWD}/jboss-4.2.2.GA&quot;</command>
					<command>echo <envar>$JBOSS_HOME</envar>
					</command>
					<computeroutput>/home/<varname>my_name</varname>/jboss/jboss-4.2.2.GA</computeroutput>
				</screen>
				<para>If the <command>echo</command> command doesn't produce any output, make sure that you are in the directory that you unzipped the JBoss binary distribution zip file to, and that the name of that directory is correct in the <command>export</command> command (i.e., that the file name hasn't changed in some subtle way).</para>
				<para>Alternatively, you can set the <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable permanently in the startup file for your shell. If you are using the Bash shell, this would mean inserting the following line into your <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> file (and making sure that the pathname is absolute): <screen>
<command>export JBOSS_HOME=&quot;<filename><replaceable>&lt;unzip_directory&gt;</replaceable>/jboss-4.2.2.GA</filename>&quot;</command>
					</screen>
				</para>
			</step>
		</procedure>
		<para>Now that the JBoss Application Server has been successfully installed, we will download the source to the Mobicents Converged Application Server with Subversion, and build it.</para>

		<procedure

			<step>
				<para>First, move to the directory that you want to install Mobicents into, and use Subversion to get the latest sources:</para>
				<screen>
<command>cd <filename><replaceable>&lt;directory_to_install_mobicents_into&gt;</replaceable>
						</filename>
					</command>
					<command>svn co http://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/trunk mobicents</command>
				</screen>
			</step>
			<step>
				<para>Once Subversion has finished acquiring the latest revision of the sources, which may take a while, then we will then proceed to build Mobicents:</para>
				<screen>
<command>ant -f <filename>mobicents/core/build.xml</filename>
					</command>
					<computeroutput>BUILD SUCCESSFUL</computeroutput>

		<title>Installing EclipSLEE: The JAIN SLEE Eclipse Plugin</title>
		<para>The Mobicents project's EclipSLEE Plugin for the Eclipse <acronym>IDE</acronym> enables and facilitates working with Mobicents and JAIN SLEE. In particular, EclipSLEE is designed to help in the creation of the following <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> components:</para>

		<para>With the EclipSLEE plugin, developers can construct complete services quickly and easily. The plug-in takes care of ensuring that the XML descriptors are correct, as well as creating skeleton Java classes to which developers can add service logic.</para>
		<formalpara>
			<title>How to Install EclipSLEE Eclipse Plugin</title>
			<para>EclipSLEE can be installed simply by adding the URL of the Update site. In Eclipse, click on 
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Help</guimenu>
					<guimenuitem>Software Updates</guimenuitem>
					<guimenuitem>Find and Install...</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice>. The <literal>Install/Update</literal> dialog box will pop up. Choose the second option, <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Search for new features to install</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice>, and click next to be presented with the <literal>Install</literal> dialog. On the right-hand side, click the <guibutton>New Remote Site...</guibutton> button to be presented with the <literal>New Update Site</literal> dialog. For the Name field, enter <userinput>EclipSLEE</userinput>, and in the <literal>URL</literal> field, enter the URL of the remote site: <userinput>http://people.redhat.com/vralev/eclipslee/update/</userinput>. Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to return to the <literal>Install</literal> dialog. Check the just-added <literal>EclipSLEE</literal> site and click the <guibutton>Finish</guibutton> button. Eclipse will then prompt you to read and accept the license agreement, and will also ask you whether you want to install all components. After following the instructions of Eclipse's plugin install wizard, the EclipSLEE plugin will be downloaded and installed (usually to the shared Eclipse plugins directory, unless you have directed Eclipse to install to another location). Restarting Eclipse is required in order to initialize the EclipSLEE plugin so that it can be used.</para>
