		<section name="Description">
			<p>
				The Media IPBX project is based on the Seam Sip Servlets framework and it's goal is
				 to demonstrate the technology and eventually become a real useful PBX product. The
				  primary design requirements for the PBX are:
				<br/>
			</p>
					<ul>
				<li>To have a dynamic Web GUI where users can log in, manipulate and monitor the call status, adjust system or profile settings and so on</li>
				<li>To allow proxy-mode and all other classic PBX operations without the need to use the Web GUI</li>
				<li>To be extensible and customizable</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
								Currently the PBX terminates all calls in Mobicents Media Server conference endpoints,
				 which allows maximum flexibility to manipulate the calls after they are established. 
				 This allows features like server-side conferencing, ringback tones, later voicemail and 
				 call recording will be added. This also allows the PBX to act as Session Border Controller.
