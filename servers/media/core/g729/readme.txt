WARNING: YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY LICENCE FEES TO USE THIS CODEC.
For more information check http://www.sipro.com/g729_licterms.php

This code is based on ITU G729 AnnexC reference implementation and works with G729
main body and AnnexA bit streams. The Encoder implementation does not pass all ITU
tests, however the quality of the speech is not affected.

This is just the initial version of the codec.
The code is slow and not optimized for anything. The performance will be improved over time.
