  <title>Default Application Router</title>
  <para>The Application Router is called by the container to select a SIP
  Servlet application to service an initial request. It embodies the logic
  used to choose which applications to invoke.</para>
  <section id="tsdar-Application-Router-Role">
    <title>Role of the Application Router</title>
    <para>An Application Router is required for a container to function, but
    it is a separate logical entity from the container. The Application Router
    is solely responsible for application selection and does not implement
    application logic. For example, the Application Router cannot modify a
    request or send a response.</para>
    <para>There is no direct interaction between the Application Router and
    applications, only between the Sip Servlets Container and the Application
    Router.</para>
    <para>The
    Sip Servlets container is responsible for passing the required information  to the Application Router within the initial request so  the Application Router can make informed routing decisions. Except for  the information passed by the
    container, the Application Router is free to make use of any other
    information or data stores. It is up to the individual implementation how the Application Router makes use of the information or data stores.</para>
    <para>The
    deployer in a SIP Servlet environment controls application composition by
    defining and deploying the Application Router implementation.  Giving the
    deployer control over application composition is desirable because the deployer is solely  responsible for the services available to subscribers. </para>
    <para>Furthermore, the SIP Servlets
    specification intentionally allows the Application Router implementation
    to consult arbitrary information or data stores. This is because the
    deployer maintains subscriber information and this information is often
    private and valuable.</para>

    <title>Mobicents Default Application Router</title>
    <para>Mobicents Sip Servlets provides an implementation of the Default
    Application Router (DAR) as defined per Sip Servlets 1.1 specification,
    Appendix C.</para>
    <section id="tsdar-DAR-Configuration-File">
      <title>the DAR Configuration File</title>
      <para>The Default Application Router (DAR) works off a simple
      configuration text file which is modeled as a Java properties file. It
      contains the information needed by the Application Router to select
      which SIP Servlet application will handle an incoming initial request.
       The properties file has the following requirements:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>It MUST be made available to the DAR and the
          location/content of this file MUST be accessible from a hierarchical
          URI which itself is to be supplied as a system property
          &quot;javax.servlet.sip.ar.dar.configuration&quot;. In the case of Mobicents
          Sip Servlets, it is also possible to configure it through the
          server.xml configuration file (See the <xref linkend="bsssc-Configuring_the_Service_Element_in_the_Containers_server.xml"/>
          for more details) or the (See the <xref linkend="wwtssmc-Working_with_the_SIP_Servlets_Management_Console"/>)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The properties file is first read by the container when it
          loads up.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The properties file is refreshed each time an application is
          deployed/undeployed.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The properties file has a simple format in which the name of
          the property is the SIP method and the value is a simple comma
          separated string value for the SipApplicationRouterInfo
          object.</para>
          <screen>INVITE: (sip-router-info-1), (sip-router-info-2)..
SUBSCRIBE: (sip-router-info-3), (sip-router-info-4)..
ALL: (sip-router-info-5), (sip-router-info-6)..</screen>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <note>
        <para>In addition to what is defined in the Sip Servlet 1.1
        Specification, Mobicents Sip Servlets defines a new keyword called ALL.  This keyword 
        allows mapping between a sip-router-info data and all methods
        supported by the container (INVITE, REGISTER, SUBSCRIBE, etc...) to
        save time for the configuration of an application that listen to all
        incoming methods. </para>
        <para>If both the ALL and a specific method are defined in
        the DAR file, the specific method takes precedence over the ALL, and
        ALL is called when there is no applications to serve for the specific
        method anymore.</para>
      </note>
      <para>The sip-router-info data that goes in the properties file is a
      string value version of the SipApplicationRouterInfo object. It consists
      of the following information :</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The name of the application as known to the container. (read
          as is present in the app-name tag of the sip.xml deployment
          descriptor of the application or the @SipApplication
          annotation)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The identity of the subscriber that the DAR returns. It can
          return any header in the SIP request using the DAR directive
          DAR:SIP_HEADER e.g &quot;DAR:From&quot; would return the SIP URI in From
          header. Or alternatively it can return any string.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The routing region, one of the strings &quot;ORIGINATING&quot;,
          &quot;TERMINATING&quot; or &quot;NEUTRAL&quot; (Currently this information is not used
          by the DAR to make routing decisions)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A SIP URI indicating the route as returned by the Application
          Router, it can be an empty string. (this can be used to route the
          request externally)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A route modifier which can be any one of the strings &quot;ROUTE&quot;,
          &quot;ROUTE_BACK&quot; or &quot;NO_ROUTE&quot; (to be used in conjunction with the above
          route to route a request externally)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A string representing in which orders the applications must be
          invoked (starts at 0). This will be removed later on and the
          position of sip-router-info data will be the order</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Following is an example of the DAR configuration file:</para>
      <para><screen>INVITE: (&quot;OriginatingCallWaiting&quot;, &quot;DAR:From&quot;, &quot;ORIGINATING&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;NO_ROUTE&quot;, &quot;0&quot;), (&quot;CallForwarding&quot;, &quot;DAR:To&quot;, &quot;TERMINATING&quot;, &quot;&quot;,&quot;NO_ROUTE&quot;, &quot;1&quot;) </screen></para>
      <para>In this example, the DAR is setup to invoke two applications on
      INVITE request, one each in the originating and the terminating half.
      The applications are identified by their names as defined in the
      application deployment descriptors and used here.</para>
      <para>The subscriber identity returned in this case is the URI from the
      From and To header respectively for the two applications. The DAR does
      not return any route to the container and maintains the invocation state
      in the stateInfo as the index of the last application in the
      list.</para>

      <title>Routing of SIP Messages to Applications</title>
      <section>
        <title>Initial Requests and Application Selection Process</title>
        <para>Initial Requests are those that can essentially be dialog
        creating (<emphasis role="bold">&quot;INVITE&quot;, &quot;SUBSCRIBE&quot;, &quot;NOTIFY&quot;, ... </emphasis>) and not part of an already existing dialog. (There is
        some other corner cases that you can check in the Sip Servlets 1.1
        specification, Appendix B Definition of an Initial Request )</para>
        <para>Those Initial requests are routed to applications deployed in
        the container according to the Sip Servlets 1.1 specification, Section
        15.4.1 Procedure for Routing an Initial Request.</para>
        <para>Here is a quick summary that takes the example of the routing
        (through the Default Application Router) of an INVITE to two
        applications deployed in the container. Those two applications are a
        Location Service and a Call Blocking application :</para>
        <para>The DAR file will contain the following information for those two
        applications to be invoked in the correct order</para>
        <para><screen>INVITE: (&quot;LocationService&quot;, &quot;DAR:From&quot;, &quot;ORIGINATING&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;NO_ROUTE&quot;, &quot;0&quot;), (&quot;CallBlocking&quot;, &quot;DAR:To&quot;, &quot;TERMINATING&quot;, &quot;&quot;,&quot;NO_ROUTE&quot;, &quot;1&quot;) </screen></para>
        <para>A new INVITE (not a re-INVITE) arrives at the container. Since
        it is a dialog creating request and the INVITE is not part of any
        dialog, the Application Router is called. It will see that the first
        application to invoke is the LocationService so it will return that
        information to the container (along with the rest of the
        sip-router-info data) so that the container knows which application to
        invoke.</para>
        <para>The container then  invokes the LocationService that proxies the
        INVITE (considered essentially as a new INVITE (see Sip
        Servlets 1.1 Specification, Section 15.2.2 Sending an Initial Request))
        to the known IP Address of the registered user for the Request
        URI.</para>
        <para>Since the INVITE has been proxied, the container will invoke the
        Application Router for the proxied INVITE to see if any more
        applications are interested into it. The Application Router will see
        that the second application to invoke is the CallBlocking application
        so it will return that information to the container (along with the
        rest of the sip-router-info data) so that the container knows which
        application to invoke.</para>
        <para>The container will route the INVITE within the container to the
        next application in the chain. </para>
        <para>The Call Blocking application will
        decide that the user calling is black listed so it will reject the
        call with a Forbidden response. Since the Call Blocking acted as a UAS,
        the Application Selection Process is stopped (the container will not
        invoke the application router anymore for this INVITE).</para>
        <para>The path that the INVITE has taken (that is, LocationService,
        CallBlocking) is called the application path. The Routing of the
        responses will now occur as explained in the next section.</para>
        <note>
          <para>The assumption of a request coming to the server was taken,
          but applications can act as UAC and also generate initial requests
          on their own. In such cases, no entry in the dar file is needed for
          the given application initiating the request to be able to route it
          to other applications in the container or outside.</para>
        </note>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Response Routing</title>
        <para>Responses always follow the reverse of the path taken by the
        corresponding request. In our case the Forbidden response will first
        go back to LocationService then back to the caller. This is true for
        responses to both initial and subsequent requests. The application
        path is a logical concept and as such may or may not be explicitly
        represented within containers.</para>
        <para>Another possible outcome could have been that the Call Blocking
        application instead of sending a Forbidden response, allowed the call
        and proxied the INVITE to the same Request URI chosen by the Location
        Service. Then when the callee sends back the 200 OK Response, this
        response goes back the same way through the application path (so in
        the present case Call Blocking, then Location Service, then back to
        the caller).</para>
        <note>
          <para>An important note here with regard to that second scenario
          that according to the Sip Servlets 1.1 specification, Sections
          15.1.2 The Role of Applications and 15.1.4 Application Independence,
          the Call Blocking application cannot just do nothing with the
          request and expect the container to route the request in its place
          (either to a next application in chain if another one is present or
          to the outside world if none is present). The Application has to do
          something with request (either proxy it or act as a UAS).</para>
        </note>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Subsequent Requests</title>
        <para>Subsequent requests are all requests that are not
        Initial.</para>
        <para>The second scenario where the Call Blocking application allowed
        the call will be used in this section to showcase subsequent requests.
        So the caller has received the 200 OK response back. Now according to
        the SIP specification (RFC 3261), it sends an ACK. The ACK arrives at
        the container and is not a dialog creating request and is already part
        of an ongoing dialog (early dialog) so the request is detected as a
        Subsequent request and will follow the application path created by the
        initial request. The ACK will go through Location Service, Call
        Blocking, and finally to the callee.</para>

  <section id="tsdar-Limitations">
    <title>Limitations of the Default Application Router</title>
    <para>It is not possible to filter out the requests based on the incoming
    request headers to target specific applications. By example, to select an
    application based on the From Header domain part of the URI is not
    possible at the moment</para>
    <para>As you would notice, this is a minimalist Application Router with no
    processing logic besides the declaration of the application order. It is
    expected that in real world deployments, the Application Router would play
    an extremely important role in application orchestration and composition.
    It is likely that the Application Router would  make use of complex rules and diverse data
    repositories.</para>
    <para>The DAR is intended to be a very simple implementation that is
    available as part of the reference implementation, and could be used
    instead of a real world Application Router.</para>
