Servlet:
  - registers entry point for all http requests to be routed to the servlet
  - forwards all http requests to /mobicents/* URIs
  - web.xml contains configuration parameters pointing to a JNDI entry point to Mobicents
  - the servlet looks up via JNDI the Mobicents entry point and forwards all requests to it
  
Resource Adaptor:
  - accepts http requests forwarded by the servlet
  - On each request, based on event set provided to the RA for active services, 
  	the resource adaptor creates HttpSessionActivity
  - the JSLEE activity is a wrapper around javax.servlet.http.HttpSession. 
  	It hides get/setAttribute and other methods, which are not needed in JSLEE environment.
  - the event fired on the activity is one of HttpSessionCreated, HttpSessionDestroyed(ActivityEndEvent), REQUEST, GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
  - a receiving SBB can respond directly to the event via the EventContext.repond() interface, or
  	obtaining HttpResponse objecet from the incoming event
