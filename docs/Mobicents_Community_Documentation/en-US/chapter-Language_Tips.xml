  <para>To maintain language consistency within the source documentation, it is important for each content author to write in a similar tone.   Maintaining consistent  tone  throughout the user guides will give the reader  the illusion  that both the Mobicents and JBCP User Documentation Suite (UDS) is maintained  by one person.   </para>
  <para>The reader will subconciously notice the consistency, will be able to easily process the information contained within the user guide, and will really appreciate the effort you have put in to keeping the writing style professional and consistent (even though they may not tell you directly).  </para>
