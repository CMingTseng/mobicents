		<para>
			In the scope of telecommunications&#39; Next Generation Intelligent Networks (<acronym>NGIN</acronym>s), Mobicents fits in as a high-performance core engine for Service Delivery Platforms (<acronym>SDP</acronym>s) and IP Multimedia Subsystems (<acronym>IMS</acronym>es).

			Mobicents enables the composition of Service Building Blocks (<acronym>SBB</acronym>s) such as call control, billing, user-provisioning, administration, and presence-sensing features. The <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym><footnote id="def-jain">
			<para>
				<acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> stands for Java <acronym>API</acronym> for Intelligent Network Service Logic and Execution Environment architecture. <acronym>JSLEE</acronym> (Java Service Logic Execution Environment) is a short synonym for <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym>.
			</para>
			</footnote> specification allows popular protocol stacks such as <acronym>SIP</acronym> to be plugged in as resource adapters. The <acronym>SLEE</acronym> Service Building Blocks have many similarities to Enterprise Java Beans (<acronym>EJB</acronym>s), and naturally accommodate integration with enterprise applications, the Web, Customer Relationship Management (<acronym>CRM</acronym>) and Service-Oriented Architecture (<acronym>SOA</acronym>) end points.

		<para>
			Out-of-the-box monitoring and management of Mobicents components is achieved via <acronym>SLEE</acronym> standard-based Java Management Extensions (<acronym>JMXes</acronym>) and Simple Network Management Profile (<acronym>SNMP</acronym>) interfaces.
		</para>
		<para>
			Beyond telecommunications, Mobicents is applicable to a wider variety of problems demanding high-volume, low-latency signaling. Examples include financial trading, online gaming, RFID sensor network integration, and distributed control.

					It needs to provide failover, fault-tolerance and efficient load-balancing. The last is critical. Game applications are cost-sensitive. Without the ability to load-balance the potentially heavy loads of multiple apps over banks of low-cost computers used to maximal efficiency, the economic model falls apart.

				We live in an unsafe world. Project P25 is focused on public safety communications digital radio interoperability. It is spurred on by growing concern which has driven many countries&#39; governments&mdash;including the US Federal Government&mdash;to reorganize in order to create focused positions to address homeland security. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (<acronym>NIST</acronym>) is building a test system for Radio-Frequency subsystem interoperability Standard, which is based on these three protocols: the Session Initiation Protocol (<acronym>SIP</acronym>), the Service Discovery Protocol (<acronym>SDP</acronym>), and the Real-time Transport Protocol (<acronym>RTP</acronym>). The reference implementation and test system will be built as SLEE services.

				Gartner predicts that sensor technologies will be part of our everyday life by the year 2015. Sensors will be everywhere: as RFID tags on consumer products, devices monitoring tire pressure, location-tracking tags carried by workers in sensitive or hazardous environments, <abbrev>etc.</abbrev> In addition, all enterprise activities will be monitored using enterprise tools connected to the network; by 2010 these, as embedded Internet devices, will represent 95% of all Internet-connected systems.

			Pervasive sensor technologies will transform the objective of IT from providing support for fundamentally manual processes to automating the execution of tasks in response to a continuously-changing environment monitored by sensors. This requires a new kind of architecture capable of delivering <emphasis>extreme</emphasis> transaction processing.
