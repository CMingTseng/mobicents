This example defines a very simple TCP/IP based protocol and shows a way to implements a JAIN SLEE Resource Adaptor that "understands" the defined protocol and converts the specific protocol messages into Java event objects. The intention of the example is to explain the relation of RA's, RA Types, protocol stacks and how the integration of external resources is done according to the JAIN SLEE specification.
