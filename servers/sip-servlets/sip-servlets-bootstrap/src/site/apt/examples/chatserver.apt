	<<Important Note :>> <This example is a modified version of the chatrom server available from the {{{http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2006/02/sip-servlet.html}BEA dev2dev}}.\
	It is has been modified to fit the new JSR 289 specification. 
	The purpose here is to demonstrate MESSAGE sip extension support.>

Chat Server

* Service Description

	A chat server is a virtual location where many instant messenger applications can talk to each other.\
	Messages that arrive in a chat room are broadcast to all other people in the room. 
	In other words, all messages are seen by all users. 
	This means when a message arrives at our server application, the user's address will be added to a list. 
	Then the message will be sent to all users in that list.

	Additionally, you could implement "commands." A command begins with a forward slash (/) and 
	is not broadcast, but instead is processed by the server itself for special features. 
	The commands implemented are:

    * /join: Silently enter a chat room without broadcasting anything.
    
    * /who: Print the list of all users in this chat room.
    
    * /quit: Leave the chat room; no more messages will come in.
 	
	 
* How to activate it

** From the binary

	You can find the war file corresponding to this example
 	{{{http://download.java.net/maven/2/org/mobicents/servlet/sip/example/chatroom-servlet/1.0/chatroom-servlet-1.0.war}here}}.\
 	Drop the downloaded war file into your <<<tomcat_home/webapps>>> directory or <<<jboss_home/server/default/deploy>>> directory  
 	
 	Get the corresponding {{{/darfiles/chatserver-dar.properties}dar configuration file}}.\
 	Drop it in your <<<tomcat_home/conf/dars>>> directory or <<<jboss_home/server/default/conf/dars>>> directory.\
	To use this dar file for this service, specify in the Service xml tag, 
	darConfigurationFileLocation attribute of the <<<tomcat_home/conf/server.xml>>> file or <<<jboss_home/server/default/deploy/jboss-web.deployer/server.xml>>>, the following :\
	<<<conf/dars/chatserver-dar.properties>>>

	You can now run your container (Tomcat or Jboss).

** From the source

	Please check out the chatserver example located under this 
	{{{https://sip-servlets.dev.java.net/source/browse/sip-servlets/trunk/sip-servlets-examples/chatserver}location}} 
	from the svn repository.
	Follow the instructions in the README.txt to build and run the example.
	
	The DAR file for this example can be found in the sip servlets impl project under the 
	{{{https://sip-servlets.dev.java.net/source/browse/sip-servlets/trunk/sip-servlets-impl/docs}docs directory}} 
	Use this as a DAR file (Service tag/darConfigurationFileLocation attribute in the tomcat or jboss's server.xml):
	file:///E:/workspaces/sip-servlets/sip-servlets-impl/docs/dar-chatserver.properties  

* How to play with it

	Starts Two SIP Chat Clients. Point them to <<<sip:just4fun@127.0.0.1:5080>>>\
	Type your message and then click on the send button 
	
	You should see the messages in both clients once they are both in the chat server 
	(that is when they sent at least one message to it).
