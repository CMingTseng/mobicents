#The following test passes, but is excluded because it
#  is very sensitive to timing and does not always pass as part of the full TCK run.
#  Considering to challange this issue on the grounds of undeterministic behaviour. 
#tests/management/sleestate/SleeStateMachineTest.xml
#The following tests pass repeatably, but sometimes fail in batch.
# Since they are time sensitive it may require the appropriate "clean" environment to run.

## tests/management/sleestate/SleeStateMachineTest.xml

# (Ivelin, June 12, 2005) this one passes once, but at the end of run() it leaves the SLEE in STOPPED state. 
#  As a result the tearDown() cannot successfully remove the profile table and repeat runs fail.
#  When run in batch mode, tests that come later in the batch fail.

# This test passes repeatably and in batch with the rest. It requires a custom policy file to be used. 
#   Currently excluded by default, because the custom policy file has certain impact on performance.
#
# Here is how to set it up:
# 1) Locate ${mobicents.home}/jain-slee-1.0-tck/config/slee-security-policy.txt
# 2) Start JBoss with the following command (adjust as appropriate to environment): 
#   C:\devtools\jboss-3.2.6>bin\run.bat -Djava.security.policy==C:\work\mobicents\jain-slee-1.0-tck\config\slee-security-policy.txt -c all -b 127.0.0.1
