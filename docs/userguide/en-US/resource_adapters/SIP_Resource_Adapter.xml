<!-- 
Here is a short guide on how to build and install the Jain Sip Resource Adapter.

    * Checkout latest source or package of sip ra 1.2. It contains ra, and sip services. Source can be obtained from svn repo: https://slee-sip-ra.dev.java.net/svn/slee-sip-ra/trunk
    * Start the Mobicents server
    * Make sure the file sipra.properties, located under $PROJECT_HOME/ra/sipra/ra/src/org/mobicents/slee/resource/sip/, contains the correct information, for example:

      # Default IP address 0.0.0.0 can pickup the IP address
      # automatically - this is not a good idea if you have
      # multiple interfaces. 
      # 
      # When javax.sip.IP_ADDRESS is not specified, the SIP RA 
      # uses the default binding address of the SLEE container 
      #
       
      #javax.sip.IP_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
      javax.sip.STACK_NAME=SipResourceAdapter
      javax.sip.PORT=5060
      javax.sip.STACK_PREFIX=gov.nist
      gov.nist.javax.sip.TRACE_LEVEL=DEBUG
      gov.nist.javax.sip.DEBUG_LOG=sipdebug.txt
      gov.nist.slee.resource.sip.AUTHENTICATION=false
      gov.nist.slee.resource.sip.AUTH_FILE=passwords.xml
      gov.nist.javax.sip.THREAD_POOL_SIZE=4
      #SPECIFIES uS after which if dialog didnt receive/or send any message is considered to be
      #timed out and removed from activities
      net.java.DIALOG_TIMEOUT=360000
      #Set uS for which CANCEL delivery is postponed in order to give sbb chance to process INVITE
      net.java.CANCEL_WAIT=1000
      #Controlls firing of TCK vents which expose internal state of RA and values passed by SleeContainer
      net.java.FIRE_X_EVENTS=true

    * use either ant deploy or ant deployall target, depending what You need - only ra or ra with basic sip services.
