	<para>Before running the Mobicents server you are installing, you should consider if you need to set the <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable. Setting it (or re-setting it to the new value) will always work. Whether or not you <emphasis>need</emphasis> to set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> depends on the following factors:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>If you are installing a <emphasis>binary</emphasis> Mobicents server and <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> is not set on your system, then you <emphasis>do not need</emphasis> to set it, but doing so will do no harm.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>If you are installing a binary Mobicents server and <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> is (already) set on your system, then you need to make sure it points to the location of the new Mobicents server.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>If you are installing a Mobicents server from source which uses the JBoss Application Server, then you <emphasis>must</emphasis> set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>The following instructions detail how to set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> on both Linux and Windows.</para>

		<title>Setting the <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> Environment Variable on Linux</title>
		<step>
			<para>The <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable must point to the location of your JBoss installation. Any Mobicents server which runs on top of the JBoss Application Server has a topmost directory, i.e. the directory in which you unzipped the zip file to install the server, and underneath that directory, a <filename>bin</filename> directory. <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> must be set to the topmost directory of your Mobicents server installation.</para>
			<para>Setting this variable in your personal <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> file has the advantage that it will always be set (for you, as a user) each time you log in or reboot the system. To do so, open <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> in a text editor (or create the file if it doesn't already exist) and insert the following line anywhere in the file, taking care to substitute <filename>&lt;mobicents_server&gt;</filename> for the topmost directory of the Mobicents server you installed:</para>
			<screen>export JBOSS_HOME=&quot;/home/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/&lt;mobicents_server&gt;&quot;</screen>
			<para>Save and close <filename>.bashrc</filename>.</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>You can&#8212;and should&#8212;<command>source</command> your <filename>.bashrc</filename> file to make your change take effect (so that <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> is set) for the current session:</para>
			<screen>~]$ source ~/.bashrc</screen>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>Finally, make sure that <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> has been set correctly (that it leads to the right directory), and has taken effect in the current session.</para>
			<para>The following command will show the path to the directory pointed to by <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>:</para>
			<screen>~]$ echo $JBOSS_HOME</screen>
			<para>To be absolutely sure, change your directory to the one pointed to by <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>:</para>
			<screen>~]$ cd $JBOSS_HOME &amp;&amp; pwd</screen>

			<para>The <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable must point to the location of your JBoss installation. Any Mobicents server which runs on top of the JBoss Application Server has a topmost directory, i.e. the directory in which you unzipped the zip file to install the server, and underneath that directory, a <filename>bin</filename> directory. <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> must be set to the topmost directory of your Mobicents server installation.</para>
			<para>If you are planning on running the JBoss Application Server as the Administrator, then you should, of course, set the <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable <emphasis>as the administrator</emphasis>, and if you planning to run Tomcat as a normal user, then set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> as a user environment variable.</para>
