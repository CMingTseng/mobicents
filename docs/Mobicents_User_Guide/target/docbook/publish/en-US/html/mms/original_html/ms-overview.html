<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With continued globalization, many corporations have workgroups dispersed around the world. To support workgroup productivity and communications companies are considering cost effective and less expansive network solutions that combine voice, wireless, data and video. These businesses expect the services they select and implement to have the high quality of the telephone and other services they now use, and they expect them to boost productivity and help reduce overall communication costs. To access the desired network services requires connections from wireless, wireline networks, and the Internet to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with flexible, robust, scalable and cost-effective media gateway. These gateways must reduce cost of communication of the dispersed workgroups and form the foundation for media services. </p>

<font size="2">Today all communication can take place through a computer. Widely accessible broadband and Internet Protocol (IP) enable voice, data and video. Media gateways provide conversation and switching voice media between a network and its access point. Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or cable modem a media gateway converts, compress and and packetizes voice data for transfer back and forth across the Internet backbone for wireline or wireless phones. Media gateways fit between the PSTN and wireless or IP-bbased networks.</font></h2>

<p>Several market demands are pushing companies to converge all of their media services using media gateways,with VoIP.Companies are expecting this architecture to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lower initial costs. Capital investment is less because hardware can be used for multiple functions.
</li>
<li>Lower development costs.Open system hardware and software standards with well defined application mean lower costs, and Application Programmable Interfaces (AAPIs) accelerate development.
</li>
<li>Handle multiple media types. Companies want VoIP solutions today, but need to select solutions that will also handle video in the near future.
</li>
<li>Lower the costs of deployment and maintenance. Standardized, modular systems reduce training costs and maintenance while also improving uptime.
</li>
<li>Enable faster time-tto-mmarket. Early market entry hits the window of opportunity and maximizes revenue. </li>
</ul>
