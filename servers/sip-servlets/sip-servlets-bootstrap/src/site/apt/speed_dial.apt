Speed Dial

* Service Description

	Speed Dial allows a calling party to specify a short speed-dial number (e.g. "1"), 
	which it translates into a complete address based on prior configuration and 
	proxies it (without record-routing, and without supervised mode).
	
	Speed Dial currently performs a lookup into a hard coded list of addresses 
	and should later evolve towards a database.
	
	Here is the list of hard coded contacts and their locations :
	 
	* "1" => "sip:receiver@sip-servlets.com"
	 
	* "2" => "sip:mranga@sip-servlets.com" (The Master Blaster)
	
	* "3" => "sip:vlad@sip-servlets.com"
	
	* "4" => "sip:bartek@sip-servlets.com"
	
	* "5" => "sip:jeand@sip-servlets.com"
	
	* "9" => "sip:receiver@127.0.0.1:5090" (Special case to be able to run the app standalone)
