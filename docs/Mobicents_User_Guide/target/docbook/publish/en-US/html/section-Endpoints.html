         <p class="formalpara">It is convenient to consider a media gateway as a collection of endpoints. An endpoint is a logical representation of a physical entity such as an analog phone or a channel in a trunk. Endpoints are sources or sinks of data and can be physical or virtual. Physical endpoint creation requires hardware installation whil esoftware is sufficient for creating a virtual endpoint. An interface on a gateway that terminates a trunk connected to a PSTN switch is an example of a physical endpoint. An audio source in an audio content server is an example of a virtual endpoint.</p>
         <p>The type of the endpoint determines its functionality. Our analysis, so far, has led us to isolate the following basic endpoint types:</p>

               <li>
                  <p>Digital Signal 0 (<acronym class="acronym">DS0</acronym>)</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Analog line</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Announcement server access point</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Conference bridge acces point</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Packet relay</p>
               </li>

               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>This list is not exhaustive: there may be other types of endpoints defined in the future, for example test endpoints that could be used to check network quality, or frame-relay endpoints that could be used to manage audio channels multiplexed over a frame-relay virtual circuit.</p>

                  <p>An announcement server endpoint naturally provides access to an announcement server. Upon receiving requests from the call agent, the announcement server will "play" a specified announcement. A given announcement endpoint is not expected to support more than one connection at a time. Connections to an announcement server are typically one-way, or "half-duplex":the announcement server is not expected to listen to the audio signals from the connection.</p>

                  <p>A conference bridge endpoint is used to provide access to a specific conference. Media gateways should be able to establish several connections between the endpoint and the packet networks, or between the endpoint and other endpoints in the same gateway. The signals originating from these connections shall be mixed according to the connection "mode" (as specified later in this document). The precise number of connections that an endpoint supports is characteristic of the gateway, and may in fact vary according to the alloction of resources within the gateway.</p>

                  <p>A packet relay endpoint is a specific form of conference bridge that typically only supports two connections.

         <p class="formalpara">This endpoint contains a set of resources which provide the media-processing functionality. It manages the interconnection of media streams between the resources, and arbitrates the flow of media stream data between them. Media servicesor commands are invoked by a client application on the endpoint; that endpoint causes the resources to perform the desired services, and directs events sent by the resources to the appropriate client. The resources in the endpoint include a primary resource and zero or more secondary resources. The primary resource is typically connected to an external media stream, and provides the data from that stream to the secondary resources. The secondary resources may process that stream (<abbr class="abbrev">e.g.</abbr> by recording it and/or performing automatic speech recognition on it), or may themselves generate generate media stream data (<abbr class="abbrev">e.g.</abbr> by playing a voice file) which is then transmitted to the primary resource.</p>
         <p>A resource is statically prepared if the preparation takes place at the time of creation. A resource is dynamically prepared if preparation of a particular resource (and its associated media streams) does not occur until it is required by a media operation. Static preparation can lead to less efficient usage of a server's resources, because resources may tend to be allocated for a longer time before use. However, once a resource has been prepared, it is guaranteed to be available for use. Dynamic preparation may utilize resources more efficiently because of Just-In-Time (<acronym class="acronym">JIT</acronym>) allocation algorithms may be used.</p>
         <p>An endpoint is divided logically into a Service Provider Interface (<acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym>) that is used to implement specific a endpoint, and a management interface which is used for implementing manageable resources of that endpoint. All endpoints are plugged into the Mobicents <acronym class="acronym">SLEE</acronym> server by registering with the MBean server. The kernel in that sense is only an aggregator, and not a source of actual functionality. The functionality is provided by the <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym> implementation of the Mbeans, and in fact, all major endpoints are manageable MBeans interconnected through the MBean server. The best way to add endpoints to a Media Server is to write a new <acronym class="acronym">JMX</acronym> bean which provides implementation of the endpoint's <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym>.</p>
         <p>The <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym> layer is an abstraction that endpoint providers must implement to enable their media-processing features. An implementation of <acronym class="acronym">SPI</acronym> for an endpoint is referred to as an <span class="emphasis">
