Click To Call

* Service Description

	This simple example shows how SIP Servlets can be used along with HTTP servlets as a converged application 
	to place calls from a web page. This example consists of the following steps:
   
   [[1]]Alice and Bob each register a SIP Softphone
   
   [[2]]Alice clicks on the "Call" link to place a call to Bob
   
   [[3]]Alice's phone rings
   
   [[4]]When Alice picks up her phone, Bob's phone rings
   
   [[5]]When Bob answers his phone, the call is connected
   
   [[6]]When one of them hangs up, the other one is also disconnected 	
	 
* How to activate it

** From the binary

	It is bundled as a default example with the binary but you can also find the war file corresponding to this example
 	{{{http://repository.jboss.org/maven2/org/mobicents/servlet/sip/example/click-to-call-servlet/1.1.2/click-to-call-servlet-1.1.2.war}here}}.\
 	Drop the downloaded war file into your <<<tomcat_home/webapps>>> directory or <<<jboss_home/server/default/deploy>>> directory  
 	
 	Get the corresponding {{{/click2call-dar.properties}dar configuration file}}.\
 	Drop it in your <<<tomcat_home/conf/dars>>> directory or <<<jboss_home/server/default/conf/dars>>> directory.\
	To use this dar file for this service, specify in the Service xml tag, 
	darConfigurationFileLocation attribute of the <<<tomcat_home/conf/server.xml>>> file or <<<jboss_home/server/default/deploy/jboss-web.deployer/server.xml>>>, the following :\
	<<<conf/dars/click2call-dar.properties>>>

	You can now run your container (Tomcat or Jboss).

** From the source

	Please check out the speed dial example located under this 
	{{{http://code.google.com/p/mobicents/source/browse/trunk/servers/sip-servlets/sip-servlets-examples/click-to-call}location}} 
	from the svn repository.
	Follow the instructions in the README.txt to build and run the example.
	
	The DAR file for this example can be found in the sip servlets impl project under the 
	{{{http://code.google.com/p/mobicents/source/browse/trunk/servers/sip-servlets/sip-servlets-impl/docs}docs directory}} 
	Use this as a DAR file (Service tag/darConfigurationFileLocation attribute in the tomcat's server.xml):
	file:///E:/workspaces/sip-servlets/sip-servlets-impl/docs/dar-click2dial.properties  

* How to play with it

	Starts Two sip phones.
	
	Open up a browser to http://localhost:8080/click2call/.
	If you have no registered SIp clients you will be asked to register at least two.\
	Configure your SIP clients to use the sip servlets server as a register and proxy. (ip address : 127.0.0.1, port: 5080)\
	By default it will accept any password, see below for instructions on how to enable
	security and authentication.\ 
	After the registration you will see a table where each cell will initiate a call between the corresponding clients.
	
	You can also navigate to http://localhost:8080/click2call/simplecall.html, which is
	a simplified version that doesn't require registered clients.\
	You will see the index page where you can enter two SIP URIs. Enter the URIs
	of the two SIP phones you just started and click "Submit".\
	The SIP phones don't have to be registered.
	
	After you pick up both phones the RTP session starts.
