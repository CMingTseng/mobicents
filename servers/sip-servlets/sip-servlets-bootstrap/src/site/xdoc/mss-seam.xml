			<p>On top of Seam, Sip Servlets and MSC API (Media Server), we have built another framework that
			allows you to handle SIP and Media events in your Seam components. The STF application are extremely
			lean and simple to code. There are a number of other advantages to using Seam - easier to mix
			Web and SIP and Media applications, hot deployment with JBoss Tools, unified component model for Web and Telco application.
