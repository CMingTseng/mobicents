The idea is to have a converged application that shows how JEE application can leverage Mobicents to have voice, message and data transfer seamlessly. This example is built using the Seam and JAIN SLEE service deployed on Mobicents.


Converged Application makes use of Sip RA, TTS RA, PersistenceRA and MediaRA

Running the Example:

HOW TO DEPLOY:
Call 'ant deploy-all' from /path_to_mobicents_distro/examples/ConvergedDemo/ 
call 'ant undeploy-all' to undeploy
call 'ant clean-all' to clean the project
