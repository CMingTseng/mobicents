Release notes

Features and known limitations:
 
* Supports sip URIs on the form sip:username@domain:port and sip:username@ipaddress:port 
(other such as sips URIs has not been tested)

* Implements a ParlayX interface

* Makes use of the following four services:

  makeCall - sets up the call between two SIP parties
  cancelCallRequest - cancel an ingoing call setup procedure
  endCall - ends the call between the two SIP parties
  getCallInformation - get call status during the whole call session; during setup, ongoing call and tear down procedure.
  	
* There is a bug in the web server that makes the getCallInformation() executing with errors when 
executing the web service in standalone mode (by using the se.jayway.sip.callcontrol.client.invoker.ThirdPartyCallInvoker). 
Therefore, the web service client invoker currently doesn't use this functionality. Instead, the flow contains 
makeCall(), wait for 10s (simulate talking) and endCall(), i.e no call status is retrieved during the 
call setup when the web service is used in standalone mode!
