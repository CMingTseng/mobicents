		<para>This high degree of modularity benefits the application developer in several ways. The already-tight code can be further trimmed down to support applications that must have small footprints. For example, if <acronym>PSTN</acronym> (Public Switched Telephone Network) interconnection is unnecessary in your application, then simply take the D-channel feature out of the server. If you later decide to deploy the same application within a Signaling System 7 (<acronym>SS7</acronym>) network, then simply enable the appropriate endpoint. Another example is the freedom you have to drop your favorite media control protocol directly into the <acronym>SLEE</acronym> container.</para>

<!--The components that are involved into media processing or Endpoints are implemented with JMF, Java Media Framework. JMF provides a platform neutral framework for displaing time-based media. The JMF API:

    * Scales across different protocols and delivery mechanisms
    * Scales across different types of media data
    * Provides an event model for asynchronous communication between JMF and applications or applets.

The JMF architecture allows advanced developers to create and integrate new types of controllers and data sources. JMF API declares abstract interfaces which used for handling new media sources or sinks like audio/video files, PSTN cards, web cams, etc.

All the endpoints management MBean and trunk management MBean extends the EndpointManagementMBean. The Trunk is collection of EndPoints. Number of EndPoint in Trunk is configured by Channels parameter. When the media server is deployed all the TrunkManagementMBean and EndPointManagementMBean are deployed from jboss-service.xml 
 
For example for AnnTrunkManagementMBean, corresponding AnnEndpointManagementMBean is created for 'channels' times and the service is started. When the start service is called on AnnEndpointManagementMBean, the corresponding AnnEndpointImpl is created and bound to JNDI using the media/trunk/Announcement/$, where $ is range from 1 to channel. 
 
Endpoint UML diagram
 
 
Each endpoint is extension of BaseEndpoint which implements Endpoint. 
AnnEndpointImpl : Is responsible for announcement and allows only one Connection at a time. It is used for playing media only. User can call
 
LoopEndpointImpl : This is used for testing the connection between the UA and media server. LoopEndpointImpl forwards the received media back to UA, so this is like echo test. 
 
 
The primary use of the Endpoint is to configure media resources in order to perform media processing (e.g., playing or recording voice files, speech recognition) on a call.The components of the Endpoint are depicted in Figure 2.

//TODO  Add the definition of each of the MediaResource
Resources are created upon request by a client. The resource configuration is defined by the client in its Session Descriptor and initial parameter settings are defined by the endpoint and used by the server to configure the resource correctly. The Media server  distinguishes between configuration and preparation. A resource is configured when its resources and media stream requirements are identified. It is prepared when the resources and media streams are exclusively allocated by the server and interconnected so as to satisfy the resource configuration. Only when a resource is prepared can it perform media services. The time at which resource preparation occurs affects the efficiency by which the server can manage its resources, as well as the failure modes that a client may experience.

For each of these parameters, the call agent can either specify a value, a range of value, or no value at all.  This allow various implementations to implement various level of control, from a very tight control where the call agent specifies minute details of   the connection handling to a very loose control where the call agent only specifies broad guidelines, such as the maximum bandwidth, and let the gateway choose the detailed values.</para>

			<varlistentry>
				<term>On/off (OO)</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once applied, these signals last until they are turned off.  This can only happen as the result of a reboot/restart or a new signal request where the signal is explicitly turned off.  Signals of type OO are defined to be idempotent, thus multiple requests to turn a given OO signal on (or off) are perfectly valid.  An On/Off signal could be a visual message-waiting indicator (VMWI).  Once turned on, it MUST NOT be turned off until explicitly instructed to by the Call Agent, or as a result of an endpoint restart, i.e., these signals will not turn off as a result of the detection of a requested event.</para>

				<term>Time-out (TO)</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once applied, these signals last until they are either cancelled (by the occurrence of an event or by explicit releasing of signal generator), or a signal-specific period of time has elapsed.  A TO signal that times out will generate an "operation complete" event.  If an event occurs prior to the 180 seconds, the signal will, by default, be stopped (the "Keep signals active" action - will override this behavior).  If the signal is not stopped, the signal will time out, stop and generate an "operation complete" event, about which the server controller may or may not have requested to be notified.  A TO signal that fails after being started, but before having generated an "operation complete" event will generate an "operation failure" event which will include the name of the signal that failed.  Deletion of a connection with an active TO signal will result in such a failure.</para>

				<term>Brief (BR)</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>The duration of these signals is normally so short that they stop on their own.  If a signal stopping event occurs, or a new signal requests is applied, a currently active BR signal will not stop.  However, any pending BR signals not yet applied will be cancelled (a BR signal becomes pending if a signal request includes a BR signal, and there is already an active BR signal). As an example, a brief tone could be a DTMF digit. If the DTMF digit "1" is currently being played, and a signal stopping event occurs, the "1" would play to completion.  If a request to play DTMF digit "2" arrives before DTMF digit "1" finishes playing, DTMF digit "2" would become pending.</para>
