	<title>Document Conventions</title>
	<para>
		This manual uses several conventions to highlight certain words and phrases and draw attention to specific pieces of information.
	</para>
	<para>
		In PDF and paper editions, this manual uses typefaces drawn from the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</ulink> set. The Liberation Fonts set is also used in HTML editions if the set is installed on your system. If not, alternative but equivalent typefaces are displayed. Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later includes the Liberation Fonts set by default.
	</para>
	<section>
		<title>Typographic Conventions</title>
		<para>
			Four typographic conventions are used to call attention to specific words and phrases. These conventions, and the circumstances they apply to, are as follows.
		</para>
		<para>
			<literal>Mono-spaced Bold</literal>
		</para>
		<para>
			Used to highlight system input, including shell commands, file names and paths. Also used to highlight key caps and key-combinations. For example:
		</para>
		<blockquote>
			<para>
				To see the contents of the file <filename>my_next_bestselling_novel</filename> in your current working directory, enter the <command>cat my_next_bestselling_novel</command> command at the shell prompt and press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to execute the command.
			</para>
		</blockquote>
		<para>
			The above includes a file name, a shell command and a key cap, all presented in Mono-spaced Bold and all distinguishable thanks to context.
		</para>
		<para>
			Key-combinations can be distinguished from key caps by the hyphen connecting each part of a key-combination. For example:
		</para>
		<blockquote>
			<para>
				Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to execute the command.
			</para>
			<para>
				Press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> to switch to the first virtual terminal. Press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F7</keycap></keycombo> to return to your X-Windows session.
			</para>
		</blockquote>
		<para>
			The first sentence highlights the particular key cap to press. The second highlights two sets of three key caps, each set pressed simultaneously.
		</para>
		<para>
			If source code is discussed, class names, methods, functions, variable names and returned values mentioned within a paragraph will be presented as above, in <literal>Mono-spaced Bold</literal>. For example:
		</para>
		<blockquote>
			<para>
				File-related classes include <classname>filesystem</classname> for file systems, <classname>file</classname> for files, and <classname>dir</classname> for directories. Each class has its own associated set of permissions.
			</para>
		</blockquote>
		<para>
			<application>Proportional Bold</application>
		</para>
		<para>
			This denotes words or phrases encountered on a system, including application names; dialogue box text; labelled buttons; check-box and radio button labels; menu titles and sub-menu titles. For example:
		</para>
		<blockquote>
			<para>
				Choose <guimenu>System &gt; Preferences &gt; Mouse</guimenu> from the main menu bar to launch <application>Mouse Preferences</application>. In the <guilabel>Buttons</guilabel> tab, click the <guilabel>Left-handed mouse</guilabel> check box and click <guibutton>Close</guibutton> to switch the primary mouse button from the left to the right (making the mouse suitable for use in the left hand).
			</para>
			<para>
				To insert a special character into a <application>gedit</application> file, choose <guimenu>Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Character Map</guimenu> from the main menu bar. Next, choose <guimenu>Search &gt; Find…</guimenu> from the <application>Character Map</application> menu bar, type the name of the character in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> field and click <guibutton>Next</guibutton>. The character you sought will be highlighted in the <guilabel>Character Table</guilabel>. Double-click this highlighted character to place it in the <guilabel>Text to copy</guilabel> field and then click the <guibutton>Copy</guibutton> button. Now switch back to your document and choose <guimenu>Edit &gt; Paste</guimenu> from the <application>gedit</application> menu bar.
			</para>
		</blockquote>
		<para>
			The above text includes application names; system-wide menu names and items; application-specific menu names; and buttons and text found within a GUI interface, all presented in Proportional Bold and all distinguishable by context.
		</para>
		<para>
			Note the <guimenu>&gt;</guimenu> shorthand used to indicate traversal through a menu and its sub-menus. This is to avoid the difficult-to-follow 'Select <guimenuitem>Mouse</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Preferences</guimenu> sub-menu in the <guimenu>System</guimenu> menu of the main menu bar' approach.
		</para>
		<para>
			<command><replaceable>Mono-spaced Bold Italic</replaceable></command> or <application><replaceable>Proportional Bold Italic</replaceable></application>
		</para>
		<para>
			Whether Mono-spaced Bold or Proportional Bold, the addition of Italics indicates replaceable or variable text. Italics denotes text you do not input literally or displayed text that changes depending on circumstance. For example:
		</para>
		<blockquote>
			<para>
				To connect to a remote machine using ssh, type <command>ssh <replaceable>username</replaceable>@<replaceable>domain.name</replaceable></command> at a shell prompt. If the remote machine is <filename>example.com</filename> and your username on that machine is john, type <command>ssh john@example.com</command>.
			</para>
			<para>
				The <command>mount -o remount <replaceable>file-system</replaceable></command> command remounts the named file system. For example, to remount the <filename>/home</filename> file system, the command is <command>mount -o remount /home</command>.
			</para>
			<para>
				To see the version of a currently installed package, use the <command>rpm -q <replaceable>package</replaceable></command> command. It will return a result as follows: <command><replaceable>package-version-release</replaceable></command>.
			</para>
		</blockquote>
		<para>
			Note the words in bold italics above — username, domain.name, file-system, package, version and release. Each word is a placeholder, either for text you enter when issuing a command or for text displayed by the system.
		</para>
		<para>
			Aside from standard usage for presenting the title of a work, italics denotes the first use of a new and important term. For example:
		</para>
		<blockquote>
			<para>
				When the Apache HTTP Server accepts requests, it dispatches child processes or threads to handle them. This group of child processes or threads is known as a <firstterm>server-pool</firstterm>. Under Apache HTTP Server 2.0, the responsibility for creating and maintaining these server-pools has been abstracted to a group of modules called <firstterm>Multi-Processing Modules</firstterm> (<firstterm>MPMs</firstterm>). Unlike other modules, only one module from the MPM group can be loaded by the Apache HTTP Server.
			</para>
		</blockquote>

		<note>
			<title>Note</title>
			<para>
				A note is a tip or shortcut or alternative approach to the task at hand. Ignoring a note should have no negative consequences, but you might miss out on a trick that makes your life easier.
			</para>
		</note>
		<important>
			<title>Important</title>
			<para>
				Important boxes detail things that are easily missed: configuration changes that only apply to the current session, or services that need restarting before an update will apply. Ignoring Important boxes won't cause data loss but may cause irritation and frustration.
			</para>
		</important>
		<warning>
			<title>Warning</title>

	<!--  This document was created with Syntext Serna Free.  --><title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
		The Mobicents User Documentation Suite (UDS) is the formalized source of product user documentaton for the Mobicents Community Project. Within the UDS, a user can learn how to install the platform, or individual servers. Server-specific features are located within each server guide and include examples that can help new users become accustomed to the functionality offered by the product suite.
	</para>
	<para>
		The UDS is written in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and uses the DocBook DTD to control guide structure. The documentation is published to HTML-Single format using the Publican Toolchain and Maven JDocBook, and subsequenty hosted on the Hudson Build Server for public viewing and comment.
	</para>
	<formalpara>
		<title>UDS History</title>
		<para>
			Originally, the UDS was delivered to the user through multiple sources such as Wiki pages and static documents. The information was hosted in different locations.
		</para>
	</formalpara>
	<para>
		The separate information sources were merged into a single wiki source, hosted on the mobicents-public Google group. Once the information was merged into mobicent-public, the developers had a single place to communicate with the end users of the platform.
	</para>
	<para>
		As the Mobicents product matured, the requirement for formalised single-source documentation became apparent. When Red Hat acquired the project, the process of merging the content into a single XML repository began.
	</para>
	<para>
		During the conversion process from Wiki to XML, the UDS was managed by Red Hat Technical Writers. Red Hat writers took the developer content and converted it into XML user documentation, adding to the existing content where the need existed. Those areas under development in the UDS were linked back to the mobicents-public forum, so readers weren't presented wtih an information dead-end.
	</para>
	<para>
		The documentation suite evolved to a point where the Mobicents Community Project team expressed interest in self-managing the community documentation, and hosting it on the GCode SVN repository. This decision simplified the way the team controlled the versioning of user guide content, and allowed the documentation to be branched when the development cycle dictated. It also assisted the Red Hat Technical Writers in developing the product documentation for the JBoss Communication Platform.
	</para>
	<formalpara>
		<title>Current UDS Status</title>
		<para>
			Red Hat has productized the community project, and ships the JBoss Communications Platform (JBCP) to internal Red Hat customers. The Mobicents UDS forms the backbone of the JBCP Product Documentation. The community project and the Red Hat writers work closely to ensure the correct information appears in the Product User Documentation.

	<!--  This document was created with Syntext Serna Free.  --><title>Documentation Repository</title>
	<para>
		The Mobicents User Documentation Suite (UDS) is stored in the <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/mobicents/source/browse/">Mobicents Google Code Subversion repository(GCode SVN)</ulink> .
	</para>
	<para>
		Because the GCode SVN contains the source code for the Mobicents Platform, the repository is available to the public in read-only format. For contributors to make changes to the repository in any way, the Mobicents project must grant specific read-write permissions to the contributor's nominated Google account.
	</para>
	<tip>
	<para>
		To obtain read-write access, notify one of the project owners listed on the Google Code Project Home Page. Ensure the Google account information is included in the request.
	</para>

		The most recent commit of the User Guide is located in the <filename>/trunk</filename> directory. Within this directory, each user guide is separated into the server folder to which it belongs. Click on the links in the list to inspect the document repository structure.

		In all docs directories, there is an en-US folder. This folder contains all the XML files that are required for the User Guide.
	</para>
	<para>
		The exception to this is the single XML file prefixed with <filename>all-</filename>. For example, in the sip-servlets-docs repository, the file is named <filename>all-SIP_Servlets_Server_User_Guide.xml</filename>. This file is used by Maven JDocBook to produce the documentation that is hosted on the Hudson Build Server.

			Never incorporate changes directly into the <filename>all-&lt;user guide name&gt;.xml</filename> file. Updating this file with documentation changes will result in lost work.

					Search <guilabel>Open Issues</guilabel> for <replaceable>[search query]</replaceable>. Click <guibutton>Search</guibutton> to retrieve the results.
				</para>
				<para>
					If a suitable match is found, check with the person assigned to the ticket to see if the defect can be appended to the existing ticket.
				</para>
				<para>
					If the existing ticket has been closed, raise a new ticket to capture the information.
				</para>
				<para>
					Be thorough in your searches; it will save duplicating tickets and unnecessary admin time spent on ticket management.
				</para>
			</step>

					<title>Trunk or Branch</title>
					<para>
						Determine what version of the server the enhancement relates to. The <filename>/trunk</filename> directory contains the latest version of the server currently in development.
					</para>
					<para>
						Most documentation changes will occur in <filename>/trunk</filename>, however there may be instances where an enhancement must be appended to previous server releases.

				<step>
					<title>Check the XML Comment for the Authoring Status</title>
					<para>
						To allow other content authors to see what sections of the guide can be edited, XML comments are used.
					</para>
					<para>
						Before making a change, you must ensure that the affected area is not being worked on (or 'claimed') by another author.
					</para>
					<para>
						Each content author is responsible for updating and maintaining the XML Comment Block at each stage of the authoring process.
					</para>
					<para>
						XML comments must be placed at the parent XML level. For example, if a change is required to content contained in a <markup>&lt;para&gt;</markup> tag within a <markup>&lt;section&gt;</markup>, the XML comment must be inserted at the <markup>&lt;section&gt;</markup> level. The XML comment uses the following structure:

								<para>
									It is easy to make XML structure errors if you are not using an XML Editing program that controls structure for you. Regularly validating your content will identify structure issues early. You will have a better idea about what section might contain the error, based on what section you have recently edited.

						<varlistentry>
							<term>Smaller Changes Result In Trouble-free Commits</term>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									Make smaller, consecutive changes to existing XML chapters, rather than large structural changes. Commit your validated changes regularly.
								</para>
								<para>
									GCode SVN can merge small changes from multiple authors effectively. However, larger changes may result in SVN mismatches. You must manually resolve the SVN mismatch conflict. This is often very time consuming, and annoying.

						</varlistentry>
						<varlistentry>
							<term>Strict Validation</term>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									If you are using an XML Authoring Tool to author changes, always enable "Strict Validation". Strict Validation will prevent the introduction of invalid mark-up to your work.

					<note>
						<para>
							If you are not using the Publican Toolchain in your daily XML editing tasks, you can still test publish using your XML Authoring tool's <function>Publish</function> feature to get an idea of what the publish might look like.
						</para>

							The operation will vary between editors, but the main thing is that the book will not publish if it is not structurally valid.

						Commit structurally valid XML back into the GCode SVN regularly throughout the day.
