		<title>The Reasoning and Need for Media Servers</title>
		<para>With the continued progress of globalization, more corporations than ever before have workgroups spread across countries and continents across the world. To support and increase the productivity of remote and telecommuting workgroups, communications companies are considering more cost effective network solutions that combine voice, wireless, data and video functionality. Businesses like these expect that the services they select and eventually implement will have call quality comparable to conventional telephone service, and they expect those services to boost productivity and reduce overall communications costs. Acquiring these desired network services requires connections from the Internet and wireless and wireline networks to Public Switched Telephone Networks (<acronym>PSTN</acronym>s) using a flexible, robust, scalable and cost-effective media gateway. The ability of such gateways to reduce overall communications costs for dispersed workgroups forms the foundation for media services and servers.</para>

		<!-- <para>With continued globalization, many corporations have workgroups dispersed around the world. To support workgroup productivity and communications companies are considering cost effective and less expansive network solutions that combine voice, wireless, data and video. These businesses expect the services they select and implement to have the high quality of the telephone and other services they now use, and they expect them to boost productivity and help reduce overall communication costs. To access the desired network services requires connections from wireless, wireline networks, and the Internet to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with flexible, robust, scalable and cost-effective media gateway. These gateways must reduce cost of communication of the dispersed workgroups and form the foundation for media services.</para> -->

		<title>Media Gateways Bridge Multiple Technologies</title>
		<para>Today, all communications can be routed through computers. Widespread access to broadband Internet and the ubiquity of Internet Protocol (<acronym>IP</acronym>) enable the convergence of voice, data and video. Media gateways provide the ability to switch voice media between a network and its access point. Using Digital Subscriber Line (<acronym>DSL</acronym>) and fast-Internet cable technology, a media gateway converts, compresses and packetizes voice data for transmission back-and-forth across the Internet backbone for wireline and wireless phones. Media gateways sit at the intersection of the PSTNs and wireless or IP-based networks.</para>
