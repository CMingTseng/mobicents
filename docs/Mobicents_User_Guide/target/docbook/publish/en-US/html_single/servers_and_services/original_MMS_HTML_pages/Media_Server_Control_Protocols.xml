  Media Server assumes a call control architecture where the call
  control &quot;intelligence&quot; is outside the Media Server and
  handled by external call control elements known as Call State
  Control Function.The media server assumes that these call control
  elements, or CSCF,will synchronize with each other to send coherent
  commands and responses to the media servers under their control.
  Server Control Protocols is, in essence, a master/slave
  asynchronous protocol, where the Server Control Modules are
  expected to execute commands sent by CSCF. Each Server Control
  Module is implemented as JSLEE application and consist of a set of
  SBBs which are in charge to communicate with media server's
  endpoints via SPI. It allows to avoid difficulties with programming
  concurrency, low level transaction and state management details,
  connection pooling and other complex-level APIs.
