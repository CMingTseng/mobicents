For the avoidance of doubt, comments, questions or particular results concerning

other remedies which Licensor may have. Licensee may terminate this 
Agreement at any time.
7.2	Upon termination of this Agreement Licensee shall: (a) permanently ceasing to 
use the TCK; (b) permanently destroy or disable all copies of the TCK remaining 
in Licensee's possession or control; and (c) upon Licensor?s request, provide

updates, technical support or other assistance concerning the TCK to Licensee or 
to any distributor or customer of Licensee for any Implementation.
8.2	The failure to exercise or delay in exercising a right or remedy provided by this 
Agreement or by law does not constitute a waiver of the right or remedy or a 
waiver of other rights or remedies. A waiver of a breach of any of the terms of this 
Agreement or of a default under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of 
any other breach or default and shall not affect the other terms of this Agreement. 
A waiver of a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement or of a default under 
this Agreement will not prevent a party from subsequently requiring compliance 
with the waived obligation. The rights and remedies provided by this Agreement 
are cumulative and (subject as otherwise provided in this Agreement) are not 
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
8.3	If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court or administrative body of 
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable such invalidity or 
unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement which shall 
remain in full force and effect. However, if in either party's opinion deletion or 
amendment of any provisions of the Agreement by operation of this Clause 
unreasonably compromises the rights or increase the liabilities of such party, then 
such party may terminate the Agreement. 
8.4	Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall operate to create a partnership 
or joint venture of any kind between the parties, or to authorise either party to act 
as agent for the other and neither party shall have authority to act in the name or 
on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way including but not limited to 
the making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any obligation or 
liability and the exercise of any right or power.
8.5	Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations 
under this Agreement (whether by operation of law, merger, change of control, or 
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that 
Licensor may assign this Agreement: (a) to any Affiliate of Licensor, or (b) in the 
event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of 
Licensor or a Licensor business unit. Any assignment or transfer in breach of this 
Clause 8.5 shall be void.
8.6	This Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between the parties in 
relation to its subject matter and replaces and extinguishes all prior or 
simultaneous agreements, undertakings, arrangements, understandings or 
statements of any nature made by the parties or any of them whether oral or 
written (and, if written, whether or not in draft form) with respect to such subject 
matter. Each of the parties acknowledges that they are not relying on any 
statements, warranties or representations given or made by any of them in 
relation to the subject matter of this Agreement, save those expressly set out in 
this Agreement, and that they shall have no rights or remedies with respect to 
such subject matter otherwise than under this Agreement save to the extent that 
they arise out of the fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation of another party.
8.7	A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the Contract 
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Agreement. 
Notwithstanding that any term of this agreement may be or become enforceable 
by a person who is not a party to it, the terms of this Agreement or any of them 
may be varied, amended or modified or this Agreement may be suspended, 
cancelled or terminated by Agreement in writing between the parties or this 
Agreement may be rescinded (in each case), without the consent of any such 
third party.
8.8	This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws 
of England and the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of 
England.
