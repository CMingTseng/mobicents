/**
 * Java class to represent the DiameterIdentity AVP type.
 * <p/>
 * The DiameterIdentity format is derived from the OctetString AVP Base Format.
 * <p/>
 * DiameterIdentity  = FQDN
 * <p/>
 * DiameterIdentity value is used to uniquely identify a Diameter
 * node for purposes of duplicate connection and routing loop
 * detection.
 * <p/>
 * The contents of the string MUST be the FQDN of the Diameter node.
 * If multiple Diameter nodes run on the same host, each Diameter
 * node MUST be assigned a unique DiameterIdentity.  If a Diameter
 * node can be identified by several FQDNs, a single FQDN should be
 * picked at startup, and used as the only DiameterIdentity for that
 * node, whatever the connection it is sent on.
