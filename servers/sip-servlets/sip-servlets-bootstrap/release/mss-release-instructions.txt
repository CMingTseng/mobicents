Checkout the branch and do mvn release:prepare -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true from there
when asked for SCM release tag, put release-<version-number>
if thet svn tag fails, do a svn update then retry  mvn release:prepare -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true (it won't prompt you for anything since it has already everything from the previous failed one) -> this problem is mainly due to compatibility issue between mvn and svn 1.5

Update your local jboss repo or create one if that is not already done (See http://wiki.jboss.org/auth/wiki/MavenReleaseRepository and ask Paul Gier to add you in the authorized list to upload to the main JBoss repository)

mvn release:perform -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true, if that fails (usually due to sip servlets management console don't know why) do cd target/checkout, and then mvn deploy -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Go into your local jboss repo and add and commit all artifacts corresponding to the release that has been done.

Go to http://hudson.qa.jboss.com/hudson/job/MobicentsSipServletsRelease/configure and make a release based on the new tag corresponding to the release that has just been made.
