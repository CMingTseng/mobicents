/**
 * Defines an interface representing the Failed-AVP grouped AVP type.
 *
 * From the Diameter Base Protocol (rfc3588.txt) specification:
 * <pre>
 * 7.5.  Failed-AVP AVP
 * 
 *    The Failed-AVP AVP (AVP Code 279) is of type Grouped and provides
 *    debugging information in cases where a request is rejected or not
 *    fully processed due to erroneous information in a specific AVP.  The
 *    value of the Result-Code AVP will provide information on the reason
 *    for the Failed-AVP AVP.
 * 
 *    The possible reasons for this AVP are the presence of an improperly
 *    constructed AVP, an unsupported or unrecognized AVP, an invalid AVP
 *    value, the omission of a required AVP, the presence of an explicitly
 *    excluded AVP (see tables in Section 10), or the presence of two or
 *    more occurrences of an AVP which is restricted to 0, 1, or 0-1
 *    occurrences.
 * 
 *    A Diameter message MAY contain one Failed-AVP AVP, containing the
 *    entire AVP that could not be processed successfully.  If the failure
 *    reason is omission of a required AVP, an AVP with the missing AVP
 *    code, the missing vendor id, and a zero filled payload of the minimum
 *    required length for the omitted AVP will be added.
 * 
 *    AVP Format
 * 
 *       &lt;Failed-AVP&gt; ::= &lt; AVP Header: 279 &gt;
 *                     1* {AVP}
 * </pre>
